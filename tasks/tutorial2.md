# Tutorial 2: Data-driven research design

### 2.1. Understanding data-driven research design

Find an empirical/data-driven legal research article and review the research design by:

1. summarizing the theory underlying the research,
2. describing the main research question(s) and hypothesis(-es),
3. explaining the main finding(s) of the research,
4. evaluating the reliability and validity of their measure(s) and measurement procedure(s), and
5. determining whether the authors disclose any issues of privacy or ethics for their research, and, if not, evaluate that choice.

Form groups of 3 and prepare a presentation covering the five points above in maximum 10 minutes.

A good place to start is to check these publications:

* The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL)
* The International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX)
* The International Workshop on Juris-informatics (JURISIN)
* Journal of Empirical Legal Studies
