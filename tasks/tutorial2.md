### 2.2. Understanding data-driven research design

This tutorial is a good preparation for the first graded assignment. Find an empirical/data-driven legal research article and review the research design by:

1. summarizing the theory underlying the research,
2. describing the main research question(s),
3. describing the main hypothesis(-es),
4. evaluating the reliability and validity of their measure(s) and measurement procedure(s), and
5. determining whether the authors disclose any issues of privacy or ethics for their research, and, if not, evaluate that choice.

Prepare a presentation of at maximum 3 slides to present to the class in maximum 5 minutes.

A good place to start is to check these publications:

* Journal of Empirical Legal Studies;
* Review of Law and Economics;
* Journal of Legal Analysis;
* Law and Society Review;
* The Journal of Legal Studies;
* JURIX conference proceedings;
* Artificial Intelligence and Law;
* Jurimetrics.
