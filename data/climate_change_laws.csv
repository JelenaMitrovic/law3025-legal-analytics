74,"The Mother Earth Law and Integral Development to Live Well, Law No 300","The Mother Earth Law is a piece of legislation that epitomises Bolivia's dedication to sustainable development, respecting the balance between human life and the natural environment, and prioritising the rights and knowledge of the country's majority indigenous population. The expressed objective of the law is to 'establish the vision and fundamentals of integral development in harmony and balance with Mother Earth to Live Well, guaranteeing the continued capacity of Mother Earth to regenerate natural systems, recuperating and strengthening local and ancestral practices, within the framework of rights, obligations and responsibilities'.<br />
<br />
In relation to climate change the law has many provisions that outline the state's vision, citizens' rights, and responsibilities. It embraces the concept of 'climate justice', defined by the ability of all Bolivian citizens to 'Live Well', especially those who are most vulnerable to climate change. It reinforces the point that some states have more of a global responsibility to respond to climate change.<br />
<br />
To encourage sustainable development of natural resources, it states that climate change trajectories should be accounted for when planning and zoning responsible land use.<br />
<br />
The law focuses on reducing the risks posed by climate change through six lines of actions:<br />
â€¢ The permanent incorporation of prevention of and managed response to natural disasters into the System of Integral Planning<br />
â€¢ Risk management for the agricultural sector to prevent diminished crop yields and food insecurity<br />
â€¢ The adoption of risk management of disasters as well as adaption to climate change across state development projects; development of informational networks to issue early warnings in times of natural crisis as well as to assist the agricultural industry and indigenous communities plan according to climate conditions<br />
â€¢ Strengthening territorial management processes of sub-national governments through the incorporation of risk management and adaption to climate change perspectives<br />
â€¢ Articulation between public and private scientific research sectors to share knowledge and co-ordinate research regarding vulnerabilities related to climate change<br />
<br />
The Law defines 'Living Well' in relation to climate change and lays out the state's legal obligations. The state will develop policies, strategies and legal techniques to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to them through strengthening institutional capacities for the monitoring of climate with the purpose of long-term planning. The state will also encourage the recuperation of traditional indigenous practices that were historically sustainable and allowed for the natural regeneration of resources.<br />
<br />
The law also establishes the Plurinational Authority of Mother Earth, within the Ministry of Environment and Water, as the state entity responsible for much of the development, overseeing and co-ordination of projects, programmes and research as it relates to climate change and the objectives of the Plurinational Plan for Climate Change. It also co-ordinates scientific monitoring of GHG emissions. The entity will operate within the framework of 'climate justice,' following the principles of Bolivia's climate change politics.<br />

One of the key objectives of the Plan is to keep the high share of renewable energy in the electric matrix. With this aim, it establishes a target of having more than 80% of the power base to be derived from renewable sources by 2030. The Plan also aims to: increase the share of electricity derived from wind and sugarcane bagasse plants; add a number of hydroelectric projects to the electricity network; expand the solar photovoltaic industry; promote the use of solar water heaters in the residential sector; as well as establish research on energy production from solid waste. The plan further encourages industrial users to increase their average consumption of ethanol by 11% in the next 10 years; brings forward the 5% biodiesel blending requirement from 2013 to 2010; and supports the creation of an international biofuels market. The Plan determines that a National Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be created to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by 2030 and to establish other measures such as incentives to replace old electric equipment with modern equipment, and create improvements in industry energy efficiency, transportation and buildings. The Plan promotes a sustainable increase in the use of biofuels in the national transportation network and establishes measures on adaptation to climate change. The plan establishes that actions should be taken to eliminate the loss of national forest cover by 2015. The plan sets targets for a consistent cut on deforestation to be accomplished in subsequent four-year periods. The goal is to reduce deforestation by 40% in the 2006-2009 period in relation to the Amazon Fund's 10-year reference period (1996-2005). This is followed by an additional 30% reduction in the 2010-2013 and 2014-2017 periods in relation to the previous 4-year period.

81,National Energy Plan 2030 (PNE 2030),"The PNE 2030 is the first study of integrated planning of energy resources held within the Brazilian government, and prepared by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (MME). It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources.

As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country's â€˜exploitable, but as yet unrealised' hydropower â€˜potential'. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region. If realised, this figure would amount to more than a doubling of the total installed national electricity generation capacity in Brazil - 121GW in 2012 (from all generation sources).

The PNE provides for the expansion of the electricity sector by 2030 with the use of energy sources: (1) Renewables - 191.35GW (92GW existed in 2010), (2) Conventional thermoelectric - 21.5GW (16GW existed in2010), and (3) Nuclear- 8GW (2GW existed in 2010).

According to the PNE 2030, energy efficiency policy will be built in aiming at guiding a set of priority projects, to be conducted under the guidance of MME, in co-ordination with the other agents of the Government.

83,"Law 11.284/2006, establishing the management of Public Forests, Brazilian Forest Service and National Fund for Forest Development","This law establishes principles for the management of public forests for sustainable production; institutes, within the structure of the Ministry of Environment, the Brazilian Forest Service (BFS); and creates the National Fund for Forest Development.<br />
<br />
In order to attest compliance with the forest management principles established by this bill, forest concession-holders should undertake independent forest audits, every 3 years at a maximum, and at their own cost. Additionally, the National Environment System (Sisnama) agencies are responsible for control and environmental inspection. The National Fund for Forest Development has a Consultative Council formed by members from the federal administration and civil society charged with overseeing the disbursement of funds and evaluating performance.<br />
<br />
Regarding REDD+/land use policies, the bill establishes the following principles for public forest management:<br />
â€¢ Protection of ecosystems, land, water, biodiversity and associated cultural value<br />
â€¢ Efficient and rational use of forests in line with local, regional and national sustainable development targets<br />
â€¢ Respect for local communities' right of access to and use of public forests and the benefits associated with conservation<br />
â€¢ Promotion of local processing, increased value-added of forest products and services, industrial diversification, technological development, and capacity-building of local entrepreneurs and labour-force<br />
â€¢ Free access to information regarding public forest management<br />
â€¢ Promotion and dissemination of research on forestry related to conservation, restoration and sustainable use of forests<br />
â€¢ Promotion of knowledge and awareness of forest conservation, recovery and sustainable use; and<br />
â€¢ Creation of stable and secure conditions for the promotion of long-term investment in forest conservation and recovery<br />
<br />
The National Fund for Forest Development (NFFD) is instituted with the purpose of promoting sustainable forestry activities as well as technological innovation in the sector. Among other things, the Fund's resources should be channelled to technical assistance, monitoring and verification, recuperation of degraded areas, rational economic use of forests and environmental education. The Fund only finances projects from public institutions or not-for-profit private institutions. The Brazilian Forest Service (BSF) is created with the exclusive mandate of managing public forests; it is equally the managing authority of the NFFD. The BSF is responsible for: training, capacity-building and technical assistance; promoting of sustainable timber and wood and sustainable forest production in general; and market scoping for forest products and services.<br />

This amendment bill is also known as Biofuel Bill, as it established a framework within which the government can regulate biofuels content. This includes the tracking of exports to make accurate calculations of the volume of renewable fuels as a percentage of the total fuel used in Canada, and the lifting of administrative burdens that would be placed on small producers and importers. The Biofuel Bill allows the federal government to implement regulations requiring 5% average renewable content in gasoline by 2010. Subsequent regulations will also require 2% average renewable content in diesel and heating oil by 2012 on successful demonstration of renewable diesel fuel use under the range of Canadian environmental conditions.<br />
<br />
In addition, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has been regulating sections of the Environmental Protection Act which directly address climate change and the emission of GHG, including:<br />

The Law seeks to promote efficient energy management, which comprises both energy efficiency and demand response.<br />
<br />
The Law establishes the legal framework and mechanisms to promote the use of non-conventional energy sources, and to foster investment, research and development of clean energy technologies. It seeks to set lines of action to comply with commitments made with regard to renewable energy, efficient energy management and GHG reduction, such as those acquired by approving the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).<br />
<br />
The Law allows the release of surplus energy into the network for all self-generators. Surplus energy of small self-generators that use FNCER is recognised as energy credits, which can be negotiated according to regulations issued by the Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission. The Law introduces a new classification for self-generators: small and large scale, but only in reference to the form of energy delivery that is classified as small scale by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit.<br />
<br />
This Law also allows small scale FNCER auto-generators to use bi-directional meters to be able to balance their consumption and deliveries to the grid; simple connection and surplus delivery procedures are to be put in place to enable such mechanisms to be implemented by residential users (Art 8.b).<br />
<br />
Distributed generation is also an important modification of the electricity sector. The new Law allows a generator close to consumption centres and connected to a Local Distribution System to deliver energy directly to consumers.<br />
<br />
Incentives for FNCER include those related to: (i) tax, through deductions on the investment income statement related to these purposes; (ii) tariffs, through the exemption from payment of import duties on machinery and equipment for this type of generation; and (iii) accounting, where an accelerated depreciation on assets is permitted.<br />
<br />
The Law provides for the establishment of a Non-Conventional Energy and Efficient Energy Management Fund (FENOGE), which may finance all or part of the programmes and projects for the residential sector, at levels 1, 2 and 3, as long as they involve small scale, self-generation solutions and promote energy efficiency and good practice. On September 16th, 2017, the Ministry of Mines and Energy issued decree n. 1543 that modifies the rules established by decree n. 1073/2015 and further details the scope, organisation and financial means of FENOGE.<br />

It promotes a planned, territorial environmental development compatible to Climate Change variability through sort, medium and long term actions.<br />
<br />
This Plan seeks the mainstreaming of climate variables and projections into environmental, territorial and sectoral planning, effectively decreasing the vulnerability of populations, ecosystems and productive sectors, and increasing the social, economic and ecosystems capacities to answer to climate events. The plan needs to be an instrument to establish strategic guidelines and bring effective tools to prioritise adaptations measures, as well as to guide sectors and territories in the development of strategies and adaptation plans to reduce their vulnerability and associated risks.<br />
<br />
The implementation of the plan is divided into four phases. Beginning in 2012, the first two stages were conceptual and methodological, followed by the detailing of specific sectoral and regional plans.

166,Ethiopian Programme of Adaptation to Climate Change (EPACC),"Summary The EPACC calls for the mainstreaming of climate change into decision-making at a national level and emphasises planning and implementation monitoring. It identifies 20 climate change risks, mainly in the following areas: health risks (human and animal); agriculture production decline; land degradation; water shortages; biodiversity; waste; displacement; distributive justice. The EPACC also identifies institutions responsible for mitigating these risks. Specific adaptation objectives include:<br />
â€¢ Reducing impacts of droughts by cloud seeding to induce rain<br />
â€¢ Establishing building and construction codes that ensure structures withstand extreme weather events<br />
â€¢ Storing food and feed in good years for use in bad years<br />
â€¢ Ensuring transportation access to disaster prone areas<br />
â€¢ Developing insurance schemes for weather damage compensation<br />
â€¢ Organising local communities for quick response to extreme weather events<br />

In 2008 the European Commission proposed binding legislation to implement the 20-20-20 targets. This 'climate and energy package' became law in 2009. The core of the package comprises four pieces of complementary legislation.
The 20-20-20 targets include:
â€¢ Reduction of EU GHG emissions by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020
â€¢ 20% of EU energy consumption to come from renewable resources by 2020
â€¢ 20% reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, by improving energy efficiency
The EU committed to increase its emissions reduction to 30% by 2020, on condition that other major emitting countries commit to do their fair share under a global climate agreement.
Member States will limit GHG emissions between 2013 and 2020 according to a linear trajectory with binding annual targets. This will ensure a gradual move towards the 2020 targets in sectors where changes take time to implement, such as buildings, infrastructure and transportation. To increase the cost-effectiveness of policies and measures, Member States are allowed to deviate from the linear trajectory to a certain degree.

The Renewable Energy Directive sets the following targets:
â€¢ At least 10% share of renewables in final energy consumption in the transportation sector by 2020
â€¢ The biofuels and bio-liquids should contribute to a reduction of at least 35% of GHG emissions in order to be recognised. From 2017, their share in emissions savings should be increased to 50 %

In the 2010 recast, the EU executive expects the overhaul to bring its energy consumption down by 5-6%, consequently slashing CO2 emissions by 5% by 2020.

Requires a common methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings. This includes: minimum standards on the energy performance of new buildings, and existing buildings that are subject to major renovation: systems for the energy certification of new and existing buildings and the prominent display of this certification and other relevant information for public buildings. Certificates must be less than five years old. Regular inspection of boilers and central air conditioning systems in buildings and an assessment of heating installations in which the boilers are more than 15 years old must be conducted.

In the 2018 recast, public buildings will have nearly zero-energy standards and by 2020, all new buildings are to be nearly zero-energy. Eliminating the current 1,000mÂ² threshold would mean that all existing buildings undergoing major renovations would have to meet minimum efficiency levels.

Member States are responsible for drawing up the minimum standards and ensuring that the certification and inspection of buildings is carried out by qualified and independent personnel.

The Directive 2018/844 amends the previous documents. It notably requires Member States to publish strategiesto 2050 on achieving a 'highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock'.

221,Combined Heat and Power Act (KWKG),"This Act aims to increase electricity generation from CHP plants, to support the launch of the fuel cell sector and funding for construction and expansion of heating and cooling systems. The law intends to contribute to an increase in electricity generation from CHP by 25% by 2020 through the modernisation of existing and construction of new CHP plants.<br />
<br />
It replaces a 2000 law on CHP. Both laws are primarily intended to promote large CHP plants affected by decreasing electricity prices as a consequence of liberalisation. At the same time the share of CHP-produced electricity was to increase to lower CO2 emissions by 23m tonnes by 2010. Half of this target is to be achieved by the CHP law, the other half by a voluntary agreement with industry. Renewable energy technologies not covered by the EEG may benefit from this law, including co-firing of biomass in fossil-fuelled power plants and biomass-fired CHP larger than 20MW. The premium cannot be combined with other support, particularly not with the EEG.<br />
<br />
In the original (2002) act, only the CHP share of the quantity of electricity produced was subsidised, which was fed into the grid at all voltage levels for general supply. With effect from 1 January 2009, CHP electricity that is fed into non-public grids or is used for self-supply is also subsidised. Subsidies for new heat networks or expanding heat networks were also included.<br />
<br />
The 2009 amendment aims to increase electricity generation from CHP plants by promoting the modernisation and construction of CHP plants, support for the fuel cell sector and the funding for the construction and expansion of heating and cooling systems, and the construction and extension of heat and cold storage capacity. With the amendments in 2008 and 2009, the percentage share of high-efficiency CHP plants in electricity and heat generation (primary energy use over 90%) will be increased from 12% to 25%.

â€¢ Achieve 20% market penetration with hybrid and electric vehicles.<br />
<br />
It also demands the establishment of the necessary international structures, including a National Energy Commission representing relevant stakeholders that would 'review the achievement of the policy targets, receive comments from stakeholders (â€¦) and feed this information back to government, recommending solutions where necessary'.<br />
<br />
Finally, it offers a layout of a 10-year Grenada Energy Development Strategy (2010-2020), which provides for adoption of energy specific legislation such as Energy Efficiency Act, Geothermal Bill, and revision of the Electricity Supply Act. The proposed Energy Efficiency Act includes the following provisions:<br />
â€¢ Mandate commercial building planning regulations(e.g. mandatory renewable sources contribution to energy consumption for new buildings);<br />
â€¢ Require the use of energy efficiency standards and building codes for ventilation, cooling, water- and process-heating, lighting and in institutional, commercial and industrial buildings;<br />
â€¢ Require all government buildings of a certain size to have periodic energy audits and compliance audits;<br />
â€¢ Mandate the compilation and publication of sectoral benchmarking data (e.g., kWh per hotel room-night for the hotels sector);<br />
â€¢ Require commercial banks to provide financial incentives for investments in energy efficiency to businesses and homeowners;<br />
â€¢ Mandate specified fuel efficiencies for imported vehicles;<br />
â€¢ Require training in 'eco-driving' practices for public and private sector organisations;<br />
â€¢ Develop, monitor, publish and update indicators of national energy consumption and efficiency.<br />

260,National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for 2010-2020,"This action plan constitutes the basis for action on resource efficiency and sustainability. The strategic objective of the EU stipulates a 13% increase in renewable energy capacity by 2020. The NREAP supersedes and overwrites the preceding target and renewable energy policy, and aims to increase renewable energy within the total gross energy consumption by 14.65% by 2020. In addition, there is a target of renewable energy accounting for 4.3% of gross final consumption of energy in 2005.<br />
<br />
The NREAP identifies significant potential in renewable energy sources, but many of them face environmental concerns as barriers and funding limitation. Some 16-17MW of hydropower could realistically be installed by 2020, but environmental concerns are limiting factors. Wind energy potential reaches several thousand MW, while also considered environmentally friendly, but it needs economic justification as it is highly intermittent. Geothermal energy potential in Hungary exceeds the global average but lack of funding is a significant barrier. Solar energy potential amounts to several tens of thousands of MW, but the most significant limiting factor is large investment cost. Heat pumps have theoretical potential of several hundred PJ, but face funding limitations. Biogas production potential in theory could exceed as much as 20% of energy demand for 2020. Biofuels have significant potential, but are limited by the financial burden of replacing current vehicles. The target trajectory of renewable energy by end use in 2020 is to increase to: 18.9% of heating and cooling; 10.9% of electricity; and 10% of transport.<br />
<br />
The NREAP provides that the following will be financed: green economy development, research and development, adaptation to use of green electricity, biofuel benefits, tariffs and tax issues. It also aims to formulate incentives through regulatory and comprehensive programmes on sustainable energy management, renewable energy, simplification of authorisation procedures, establishment of regional energy agencies, and review of energy certification procedures for buildings.

General objectives and priorities of the period between 2008 and 2025 are set, and the strategy is to be implemented by the National Climate Change Program (NCCP).<br />
<br />
The NCCS is structured as following: framework for the elaboration of the climate strategy; mitigation of climate change; adaptation to the changing climate; and implementation of the strategy. The reduction target for 2025 is reduction by 16% to 25% from the 1990 level in case of a unilateral 20% reduction by the EU, or 27% to 34% from the 1990 level in case of a conditional target reduction of 30% by the EU. The implementation phase first addresses adoption of a National Climate Change Programme (NCCP) for a two-year period. Monitoring is applicable to NCCS and also the NCCP, which is to be prepared by a set of indexes that reflect the climate change efficiency of the economy or the carbon reduction (e.g. GHG emission per GDP, emission per capita, energy intensity).<br />
<br />
The NCCS identifies three major directions of actions for the long term climate change policy: to comply with EU and international requirements in order to reduce GHG emissions by reducing overall energy use; to fight against the unfavourable ecological and socio-economic effects of the inevitable climate change and improve adaptability to climate change impacts; and to raise social awareness of climate change.

322,Smarter Travel - A Sustainable Transport Future: A New Transport Policy for Ireland 2009-2020,"This document reflects the government's vision and required measures to have a sustainable transport system by 2020. It sets out below five goals:<br />
â€¢ To reduce overall travel demand<br />
â€¢ To maximize the efficiency of the transport network<br />
â€¢ To reduce reliance on fossil fuels<br />
â€¢ To reduce transport emissions<br />
â€¢ To improve accessibility to transport<br />
<br />
In order to achieve these goals and ultimately ensure that sustainable travel and transport is in place by 2020, the following key targets are proposed:<br />
â€¢ Future population and employment growth will take place predominantly in sustainable compact forms, which would reduce the need to travel for employment and services<br />
â€¢ 500,000 more people will make alternative means to commute and total share of car commuting will drop from 65% to 45%<br />
â€¢ Support and provide alternative methods such as walking, cycling and public transport, to rise the share to 55% of total commuter journeys to work<br />
â€¢ Total kilometres travelled by the car fleets in 2020 will not increase significantly from current levels<br />
â€¢ Reduction of GHG emission from transport sector will be achieved compared to the 2005 level<br />
<br />
Following these objectives and targets, following key actions are proposed:<br />
â€¢ Reduce distance travelled by private cars and encourage smarter travel (e.g. encourage people to live close to workplaces, use pricing mechanisms or fiscal measures to encourage behavioural changes)<br />
â€¢ Ensure alternatives to the car are more widely available, mainly through radically improved public transport service and through investment in cycling and walking.<br />
â€¢ Improve the fuel efficiency of motorised transport through improved fleet structure, energy efficient driving and alternative technologies.<br />
â€¢ Strengthen institutional arrangements to deliver the targets.<br />

325,Sustainable Energy Act Number 2 of 2002,"This Act amends the Gas Act of 1976, Electricity Regulation Act of 1999, and it establishes the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) as the main actor whereby the functions of this Act are assigned to. The functions of the SEAI are:<br />
â€¢ To promote and assist environmentally and economically sustainable production, supply and use of energy<br />
â€¢ To promote and assist energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy<br />
â€¢ To promote and assist the reduction of GHG emissions and transboundary air pollutants associated with the production, supply and use of energy<br />
â€¢ To promote and assist the minimising of the impact on the environment of the production, supply and use of energy<br />
â€¢ To promote and assist research, development and demonstration of technologies connected with the abovementioned objectives<br />
â€¢ To provide advice, information and guidance to Ministers, ministerial bodies and energy suppliers and users relating to the abovementioned matters<br />
The SEAI has the powers necessary to perform abovementioned functions. This includes the following: cooperating with the Central Statistics Office and acting as an agent of the Office; licensing, regulation and control of activities; initiation, development, administration, promotion of and participation in schemes and programmes.<br />
An amendment in 2012 conferred a number of additional responsibilities on the SEAI to give affects to EU Directives. The SEAI is required to develop a scheme of certification or equivalent qualification, for installers of renewable energy sources, including biomass, solar thermal systems, shallow geothermal systems and heat pumps. It is to provide information on the availability, environmental benefits and net cost benefits of these energy sources and make guidance available to other consumers, in particular planners and architects, in relation to uses of energy from renewable sources in planning and building or renovating industrial or residential areas. The SEAI should work to raise awareness of, and offer training programmes relating to, renewable sources in order to inform the public as comprehensively as possible of their benefits and practicalities. It must therefore encourage the use of certain, particularly efficient, biomass technologies, heat pumps and solar thermal energy technologies as well as other appropriately certified equipment based on European standards.<br />
A 2014 amendment introduced the certification scheme for installers of biomass, heat pump, shallow geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energies.

332,The First National Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Plan and Government decision 2508,"The National Plan for the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions aims to reduce emissions by 20% compared to a business-as-usual scenario by 2020.<br />
<br />
The main strategies relate to energy efficiency, green building, and transportation. A key element was a government-sponsored programme of subsidies administered jointly by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Investment Centre in the Ministry of Economy, aimed at encouraging investments in energy efficiency and GHG reduction projects and at advancing new Israeli technologies. The Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Economy grants additional assistance (ILS40 million, USD10.4 million) to approved projects, based on new Israeli technologies (first installation).<br />
<br />
Key elements of the National Plan included:<br />
â€¢ Reducing residential energy consumption - (responsibility of Ministry of Energy and Water Resources)<br />
â€¢ Support for investments in GHG emissions reductions (responsibility of Ministry of Environmental Protection)<br />
â€¢ Support for Israeli technologies and green innovation (responsibility of Ministry of Economy)<br />

339,"Law no. 116, ratifying with amendments the Law Decree no. 91 of 24 June 2014 on 'Urgent provisions for the agricultural sector, environment, company development and, inter alia, reduction of energy bills'","The Law ratifies with amendments the Law Decree on 'Urgent provisions for the agricultural sector, environment, company development and reduction of energy bills' and lays down new provisions on feed-in-tariffs for photovoltaic and other renewables sources plants.<br />
<br />
It regulates the restructuration of feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic plants (capacity > 200 kW). Starting from 1st January 2015, the feed-in-tariffs are to be paid based on one of the following three options, to be selected by the owner of the plant:<br />
a) Current feed-in-tariffs will be reduced depending on the actual remaining period of life of the plant (from 25% for 12 years remaining to 17% for more than 19 years remaining) and distributed over a period of 24 years starting from the grid connection date instead of 20 years<br />
b) The fixed reduction of feed-in-tariffs, when the owner of the plant can opt for a reduction of the current feed-in-tariffs by a fixed percentage over the 20-year period (same as before). The Law now provides for the following different percentages, depending on the nominal capacity of the plant:<br />
â€¢ 6% for plants with nominal capacity with nominal capacity of 200 - 500kW;<br />
â€¢ 7% for plants with nominal capacity with nominal capacity of 500 -900kW;<br />
â€¢ 8% for plants with nominal capacity above 900 kW.<br />
c) The variable restructuration of feed-in-tariffs, which provides for current feed-in-tariffs to be reduced initially by a certain percentage and increased, by the same amount, at a later stage. The aim of introducing such option is to ensure annual savings of EUR600m (USD753m) over 2015-2019.<br />

In addition, the Law provides that owners can sell up to 80% of their expected future feed-in-tariffs to a third investor (selected among European leading financial operators through competitive tenders).",legislative,Italy,ITA,,"Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply",20/08/2014 | Law passed
340,National Energy Strategy (Interministerial Decree of 8 March 2013),"The National Energy Strategy (NES), which has a double time horizon (2020 and 2050), directs efforts towards substantially improving the competitiveness of the energy system and environmental sustainability.<br />
The results expected by 2020 are:<br />
â€¢ Wholesale prices of all energy sources will be aligned with average European average price levels, resulting in savings of about EUR9bn (USD11.3bn)/year in the overall power and gas bill (from current EUR70bn (USD87.8bn) - assuming same commodity prices).<br />
â€¢ Expenditure on energy imports will be reduced by about EUR14bn (USD17.6bn)/year from the present EUR62bn (USD77.8bn), and dependency on foreign supplies from 84% to 67%, thanks to energy efficiency, increased production from renewables, lower electricity imports and increased production from national resources.<br />
â€¢ Private investment of EUR180bn (USD213bn) will be supported by incentives between now and 2020 in renewables and energy efficiency and in traditional sectors (electricity and gas networks, re-gasification plants, storage, hydrocarbon development).<br />
â€¢ GHG emissions will fall by about 21% compared to the 2005 level, exceeding the European 20-20-20 targets for Italy.<br />
â€¢ Renewable energy sources will account for 19-20% of gross final consumption (compared with about 10% in 2010). This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).<br />
â€¢ Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.<br />
To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:<br />
â€¢ Fostering Energy Efficiency<br />
â€¢ Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices<br />
â€¢ Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive<br />
â€¢ Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production<br />
â€¢ Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level<br />
â€¢ Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection<br />
â€¢ Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient<br />
â€¢ Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system<br />
The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:<br />
â€¢ The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical<br />
â€¢ The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure<br />
â€¢ A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport<br />
â€¢ The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario",executive,Italy,ITA,,"Research And Development, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand",08/03/2013 | Law passed

<br />
The Strategic Framework underpinning the policy addresses both the supply and demand energy issues Jamaica faces. It prioritises seven key areas:<br />
â€¢ Security of energy supply through diversification of fuels as well as development of renewable energy sources<br />
â€¢ Modernising the country's energy infrastructure<br />
â€¢ Development of renewable energy sources<br />
â€¢ Conservation and efficiency in energy use<br />
â€¢ Development of a comprehensive governance/regulatory framework for the energy sector<br />
â€¢ Enabling government ministries and agencies to be models/best practice for the rest of society in terms of energy management<br />
â€¢ Eco-efficiency in industries<br />
<br />
Finding environmentally sustainable energy solutions is central to the document. It seeks to facilitate cultural, institutional and technological change in a way that supports 'aggressive' advances in energy efficiency and conservation, minimises greenhouse emissions and ultiÂ¬mately provides green growth. These energy efficiency and conservation goals are seen as 'no regrets' mitigation actions that can have positive impacts on society and the economy, principally by reducing costs and dependency on fossil fuel imports.<br />
<br />
Among stated goals of the policy is that Jamaica realises its energy resource potential through the development of renewable energy sources and enhances its international competitiveness and energy security while reducing its carbon footprint.<br />
<br />
Five sub-policies exist to support the National Energy Policy, namely:<br />
â€¢ A Carbon Emissions Trading Policy developed to address Jamaica's participation in the Clean Development Mechanism<br />
â€¢ National Renewable Energy Policy 2010-2030<br />
â€¢ National Energy from Waste Policy 2010-2030<br />
â€¢ Energy Conservation and Efficiency Policy<br />
â€¢ Biofuels Policy<br />
<br />
Overall the policy propose to reduce the percentage of petroleum in the country's energy supply mix from the current 95% (does not state to what level) and increase the percentage of renewables in the energy mix with proposed targets of 11% by 2012, 12.5% by 2015 and 20% by 2030.<br />

<br />
This is Jamaica's first long-term national development plan and covers a 21-year period. It provides a framework to ensure that the management of natural hazards, which are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under climate change, is integrated into Jamaica's development and that hazard considerations are systematically incorporated into development policy.<br />
<br />
Vision 2030 Jamaica has four national goals, aligned to 15 National Outcomes. Following from the national outcomes are 82 National Strategies, with sector strategies and actions. Climate change is positioned under the goal of Jamaica having a healthy natural environment. Another goal is 'Hazard Risk Reduction and adaptation to climate change'. There are four specific National Strategies here:<br />
â€¢ Improve resilience to all forms of hazards<br />
â€¢ Develop measures to adapt to climate change<br />
â€¢ Contribute to the effort to reduce the global rate of climate change<br />
â€¢ Improve emergency response capability<br />
<br />
There is also a sector plan on Climate Change, whose National Strategies include diversification of the energy supply and the promotion of energy efficiency and conservation. The Vision sees this as a 'win-win' opportunity, reducing spending on imported oil, pollution and pollution-related illness. Finally, reforestation efforts are seen as a means to mitigate climate change and improve watersheds and reduce landslides and erosion.",executive,Jamaica,JAM,,"Research And Development, Redd+ And Lulucf, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation",01/05/2009 | Law passed
360,The Natural Resources Conservation Authority (Air Quality) Regulations,"Regulates the emissions of particulates and substances deleterious to human health. This includes the licensing of premises and plants which produce such polluting substance; fees for discharge; and inspection.<br />
<br />
The Natural Resources Conservation Authority Act enabled the implementation of the Air Quality Regulations and these regulations legislate for the licensing, monitoring, and collection of fees for emissions. These emissions specifically include the term GHGs, and name these. The regulations seem to refer only to industrial sources, specifying facilities and stack emissions. The implication of these regulations is that industrial emissions will be licensed, monitored and have fees levied against them.<br />
<br />
Every owner of a major facility must apply for an air pollutant discharge licence and licensees must submit emissions reports for each calendar year. This report should contain estimates of the emissions for the year, based on the following details:<br />
â€¢ Continuous emission monitoring data<br />
â€¢ Calculation of SO2 emissions based on fuel use and sulphur content data (combustion processes in which exhaust gases do not come in contact with products)<br />
â€¢ Most recent and representative stack monitoring measurements conducted in the previous five years and activity data for the year for which emissions are estimated<br />
â€¢ AP42 emission factor or equivalent methods and activity data for the year<br />
â€¢ AP42 emission factor or equivalent methods and plant capacity data<br />
â€¢ Mass balance (including fuel use data) based on the two previous years or the most recent representative year<br />
â€¢ Other approved methods supported by calculation and documentation<br />
<br />
Further, the Regulations impose Discharge Fees on Licensees. Crucially, these fees are waived for emissions derived from the burning of renewable fuels, such as landfill gas and agricultural waste.<br />
<br />
Where the regulations are not adhered to, sanctions may be applied to the licence holder. The management Authority (individual or body authorised under the regulations) may then:<br />
â€¢ Issue a control order<br />
â€¢ Impose administrative penalties<br />
â€¢ Suspend or revoke any licence<br />
â€¢ Refuse an application for renewal of any licence<br />
â€¢ Apply to the Supreme Court for an injunction to prohibit the operation of the facility or any source at the facility<br />

The law states that to achieve the objectives the government will focus on:<br />
â€¢ Increasing investment in renewable energy extraction, thereby increasing the proportion of renewables in the energy mix<br />
â€¢ Working towards sustainable development through environment-friendly energy extraction<br />
â€¢ Pursuing rational and efficient energy extraction<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is in charge of enacting the law, and a first order of business was the identification of geographic areas for renewable energy exploitation. These areas, co-ordinated with the Ministry's Energy Master Plan, will be prioritised for development in a Land Use List, approved by the Council of Ministers. Areas identified for exploitation that are 'treasury land' (owned by the state) shall be allocated to renewable energy projects. Lands owned by individuals shall be purchased based on existing legislative authority, if approved by the Council of Ministers.<br />
<br />
In addition to hosting a competitive bidding processes to develop projects on lands prioritised on the Land Use List, individuals or projects may approach the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources with a specific proposal to develop an extraction site on any lands in the country (already identified on the Land Use List or not) which have not already been allocated by a public tender. The law outlines the requirements for such proposals and a general outline for the decision making process.<br />

The text lays the legal framework to develop national and regional programmes to exploit renewable energy, establish norms associated with renewable energy production, and issue permits for new projects and plants. This regulatory authority will rest in a government-authorised body (of the executive branch) in charge of all renewable energy programmes.<br />
<br />
At the regional and local levels, the Authority both authorises local executive authorities to participate in the planning and approval of local and regional projects to develop renewable energy up to 25MW and obliges them to reserve and allocate local lands to said projects, within the framework of the law.<br />
<br />
Renewable energy prices are set by the provider but must not exceed the estimated price stated in the feasibility study submitted to and approved by the appropriate governing body. Those companies operating regional power grids are legally obliged to buy all renewable energy produced by plants connected to the grid up to 50% of their total energy purchases. Should renewable energy exceed 50% of energy purchased by companies operating regional energy grids, the national grid shall purchase the surplus in its entirety. Additional incentives to develop renewable energy projects include prioritising the connection of renewable energy plants to energy grids and the use of renewable energy once those plants have access to the grids, and the exclusion of 'service payments' associated with the sale and purchase of traditionally produced energy.<br />

The Concept was developed within the framework of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, 2002) by the Ministry of Environment with support from UNDP, UNEP-EU, as well as scientists and experts.<br />
<br />
This policy calls for the increase of the environmental sustainable index up to 10% by 2012, 15% by 2018, and 25% by 2024.<br />
<br />
The Concept lays out the four stages of development:<br />
â€¢ Preparation stage (2007-2009) is to establish the institutional readiness to integrate sustainable development principles into all aspects of political and economics spheres<br />
â€¢ In the first stage (2010-2012) the country aims to become one of the fifty most competitive countries in the world economy<br />
â€¢ During the second stage (2013-2018) the focus is on quality of life for citizens, decrease in environmental degradation, and increase of environmental sustainability<br />
â€¢ The third stage (2019-2024) Kazakhstan will achieve international standards of sustainable development<br />
<br />
The general goal of the Concept is 'to achieve an economic, social, environmental, and political balance of the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan as a base for improvement of quality of life and provision for the competitiveness of the country in the long-term period.'<br />
<br />
The decree lays out eight principles for Kazakhstan's sustainable development broadly related to improving the economic and social development indicators of the country. The principles are followed by 16 priorities, a number of which are related directly or indirectly to climate change mitigation or adaption. Those priorities are:<br />
â€¢ Introduction of sustainable models of production and consumption<br />
â€¢ Introduction of innovative environmentally safe technologies<br />
â€¢ Development of sustainable transportation systems<br />
â€¢ Energy efficiency and energy saving<br />
â€¢ Development of science and education for sustainable development<br />
â€¢ Prevention and alleviation of environmental threats to the human health<br />
â€¢ Decrease of emissions, including GHG and ODS<br />
â€¢ Access to quality drinking water<br />
â€¢ Solutions to trans-boundary environmental problems<br />
â€¢ Waste management<br />
<br />
The section on environmental sustainability highlights the need to follow a development path that decreases the anthropogenic impact on climate change. The plan stipulates that the country should use national and local budgets in addition to international loans and grants to achieve its sustainable development goals; the adoption and enforcement of 'polluter pays' policies meant to penalise those entities that contaminate the environment (including excessive CO2emissions), the introduction of trading emissions quota system (the ETS, now in its first year of operation).",executive,Kazakhstan,KAZ,,"Transportation, Research And Development, Redd+ And Lulucf, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation",14/11/2006 | Law passed

393,General Law on Climate Change,"The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000.

The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities.

Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios.

The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes.

The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner.

The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law.

395,Special Tax Law on Production and Services (carbon tax and credits),"The 2012 amendments to the Special Tax Law introduced Mexico's carbon tax. It covers fossil fuel sales and imports by manufacturers, producers, and importers and is capped at 3% of the sales price of the fuel. Rather than imposing a levy on the full carbon content of fuels, it taxes the additional amount of emissions that are generated compared to if natural gas (not currently subject to tax) was used instead. Companies may also choose to pay the tax with credits from local CDM projects, which support the development of carbon trading schemes within Mexico. The carbon tax is updated yearly and announced in December to be implemented on January 1st each year.<br />
<br />
The 2013 amendments also introduced carbon credits. These credits are a translation into Mexican Law of the Kyoto Protocol and the subsequent UNFCCC texts.

439,Electricity Act,"The Electricity Act (E-Act) 1998 is an important basis for the creation of the electricity market in the Netherlands. By establishing this market, producers and suppliers of electricity were able to offer electricity on a market.<br />
<br />
On April 9, 2018, the Energy Transition Act (wet VET) was adopted to amend the 1998 document and the Gas Act. The objective of this Act is to make the uptake of renewable energies in the country easier by reviewing extensively and in much detail the previous legal framework.<br />
<br />
The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.<br />
<br />
The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.<br />
<br />
As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a â€˜free category' to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014).<br />
<br />

The ultimate goal envisioned is for Pakistan to be one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2047. The following pillars of the vision meet elements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs):<br />
- People first: developing social and human capital and empowering women<br />
- Growth: sustained, indigenous, and inclusive growth<br />
- Governance: democratic governance - institutional reform and modernisation of the public sector<br />
- Security: energy, water and food security<br />
- Entrepreneurship: private sector and entrepreneurship-led growth<br />
- Knowledge economy: developing a competitive knowledge economy through value addition<br />
- Connectivity: modernising transport infrastructure and regional connectivity.<br />
<br />
While the overall direction of the document is development of the country, climate change is considered as one of the challenges the country would face that requires mitigation and adaptation. Pakistan's vulnerabilities are seen as an important challenge of its transition towards a high level of sustained growth. Following vulnerabilities and challenges are mentioned in the document:<br />
- Water security: current water availability is less than 1,100 cubic meters per person, down from 5,000 cubic meters in 1951; Pakistan's water storage capacity is limited to 30 days<br />
- Food security: Pakistan ranks 76th of the 107 countries on the Global Food Security Index<br />
- Glacial melt: Indus basin (water reservoir) affected by the glaciers in the Hindukush-Karakoram and Himalayas<br />
- Biodiversity threat caused by climate change: habitat destruction and alteration, biotechnology (such as basmati rice, turmeric and neem) and threats of genetically modified seeds and germplasm to indigenous species<br />
- Energy security: alternative energy<br />
- Institutions that favour the status quo<br />
- Infrastructure bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The Vision 2025 stands upon the target fulfilment of the MDGs and SDGs by 2030. The document also sets out 25 goals in accordance to the 7 pillars. The goals that are related to the purpose of this study are as follows:<br />
- Double power generation to over 45,000MW, to provide uninterrupted and affordable electricity<br />
- Increase access to electricity from 67% to 90% of the population<br />
- Improve generation mix (15%) and reduce distribution losses (10%) to reduce average cost per unit by over 25%<br />
- Increase the share of indigenous sources of power generation to over 50%<br />
- Address demand management by increasing usage of energy efficient appliances and products to 80%<br />
- Increase water storage capacity to 90 days<br />
- Improve water use efficiency in agriculture by 20%<br />
- Ensure access to clean drinking water for all citizens<br />

There is an explicit acknowledgement of the risks posed to water, food and energy security posed by climate change; and the need to minimise the risks from the increased frequency and intensity of events like floods and droughts.&nbsp;<br><br>The policy seeks international finance to support the development required to meet these numerous challenges. However, in addition to directly seeking finance, the policy seeks to create economic incentives to encourage public and private sector investment in adaptation measures and the promotion of conservation of natural resources and long-term sustainability. All relevant ministries, departments and agencies will have to devise their own plans and programmes to implement policy provisions relating to their sectors.

460,National Forest Policy,"This policy (supported by caveats in the National Environment Policy) addresses the sustainable use of renewable natural resources. It acknowledges the multiple functions of Pakistan's forests, such as carbon storage for climate change mitigation. However, there is a particularly strong focus on forests' role in mountain areas where they provide protection from soil erosion and reduction of downstream siltation; and crucially, watershed protecÂ¬tion. It also notes the potential of forests to support local livelihoods in terms of provision of non-timber forest products (mushrooms, medicinal plants etc.).

Much of Pakistan's forests have now been cleared, increasing the importance of managing what remains under a framework of sustainable use. In particular the sustainable use should benefit marginalised groups such as women and children. Use of existing resources should be complemented with forest restoration activities to attempt to regenerate forests in order to safeguard economic growth.

Approaches to achieve the desired sustainable use of forests include the substitution of firewood and timber (specifically discouraging the use of rare species in government buildings); and the prevention of encroachment on remaining forest lands through regulation of grazing.

In order to finance the protection of watersheds and safeguard Pakistan's water supply, the forest policy stipulates the creation of a forest fund. The fund may also be used to finance the promotion of forestry research and education in Pakistan.

The need for the NSDS is stark since the country faces a series of significant challenges: Growth rates are currently largely coupled to resource and natural material use, leading to continued environmental degradation. This has contributed to increasing water scarcity, a significant problem given that storage capacity and water efficiency delivery is low. In the energy sector, thermal efficiency is low, distribution losses are high, and power cuts are reported to be a common frustration for domestic and business users. In addition, strategic energy reserves are low. These problems are set against a backdrop of high poverty and illiteracy rates in addition to increased impacts of natural hazards, notably the impact of disastrous flooding.<br />

At the same time, this plan will provide a policy environment that will encourage the participation of the private sector to optimize mitigation opportunities towards sustainable development.<br />
It is a comprehensive plan that provides key actions that:<br />
- enhances adaptive capacity and resilience of communities and natural ecosystems to climate change<br />
- adopts the total economic valuation of natural resources while ensuring biodiversity conservation<br />
- recognises the competitive advantage of putting value on the direct use, indirect use, option to use and non-use of environment and natural resources, as a short to long-term sustainable development goal.",executive,Philippines,PHL,No,"Redd+ And Lulucf, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation",01/11/2011 | Law passed
475,Framework Strategy on Climate Change,"The National Framework Strategy sketches a clean development path, and serves as a roadmap for national and sub-national development and investment programmes, physical and land use programmes. Acknowledging the Philippines' vulnerability to climate change, the Framework's vision is 'to build the adaptive capacity of communities and increase resilience of natural eco-systems to climate change, and optimise mitigation opportunities towards sustainable development'.<br />
<br />
On renewable energy, it states a target of doubling renewable energy capacity from 4,500 MW to 9,000 MW in the next 20 years<br />
<br />
The mitigation pillar leans on managing energy demand, via energy efficiency and conservation programmes, and on energy supply, via use of low-carbon and renewable energy resources, targeting a doubling of renewable energy capacity by 2030. It encourages low-carbon transportation modes (LPG, bio-fuels) and sustainable, energy-conserving infrastructure building. The infrastructure emphasises the importance of REDD+ policies as a measure to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Waste management and methane collection are also included in mitigation priorities.<br />
<br />
The Adaptation pillar includes enhanced vulnerability and adaptation assessments, eco-system management (river basin management, coastal and marine systems, biodiversity); water management; climate-responsive agriculture; climate-responsive health sector; climate-proofing infrastructure; and disaster risk reduction.<br />
<br />
The synergy between mitigation and adaptation is emphasised, and cross-cutting strategies are portrayed, among others capacity building in all level of governance, knowledge management and education; research and development and technology transfer. The framework presents the Philippines' second GHG emission inventory (updated to 2000), which has been prepared for the second communication to the UNFCCC.",executive,Philippines,PHL,No,"Transportation, Research And Development, Redd+ And Lulucf, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation",28/04/2010 | Law passed
476,Philippine Disaster Reduction and Management Act (RA 10121),"The Act shifted the policy environment and the way the country deals with disasters from mere response to preparedness. RA 10121 provides a comprehensive, all-hazard, multi-sectoral, inter-agency, and community-based approach to disaster risk management through the formulation of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework.<br />
<br />
A National Disaster Risk Management Plan (NDRMP) is being formulated, developed, and implemented as the master plan that will provide the strategies, organisation, tasks of concerned agencies and local government units, and other guidelines in dealing with disasters or emergencies. Through this plan, a coherent, integrated, efficient, and responsive disaster risk management at all levels will hopefully be achieved.<br />
<br />
The law also promotes the development of capacities in disaster management at the individual, organisational, and institutional levels. A very important feature of this law is its call for the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in physical and land-use planning, budget, infrastructure, education, health, environment, housing, and other sectors.<br />
<br />
RA 10121 also recognises local risk patterns and trends and decentralisation of resources and responsibilities and thus encourages the participation of NGOs, private sectors, community-based organisations, and community members in disaster management. It inhibits the full participation of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and communities in governance. The approach tends to be 'response-oriented' or 'reactive.' This is evidenced by the widespread emphasis on post-disaster relief and short-term preparedness, such as forecasting and evacuation, rather than on mitigation and post- disaster support for economic recovery.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the Act mandates the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) in every province, city and municipality, and a Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC) in every barangay.<br />
<br />
The Strategic National Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction for 2009-2019 aims to enhance the capacities of Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils.<br />
<br />
Finally, RA10121 provides for the calamity fund to be used in support of disaster risk reduction or mitigation, prevention, and preparedness activities for the potential occurrence of disasters and not just for response, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.",legislative,Philippines,PHL,,"Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Adaptation",27/05/2010 | Law passed

489,Resolution of Council of Ministers 20/2013 establishing the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (PNAEE 2016) and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PNAER 2020),"This Resolution established the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (PNAEE 2016) and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PNAER 2020). It repeals the PNAEE 2015, approved by the Resolution of Council of Ministers 80/2008, of 16 May 2008. It is underpinned by the idea that reducing oil dependency reduces the foreign trade deficit, as well as CO2 emissions.

Within the framework of European '20-20-20' targets, Portugal established a general target to be achieved by 2020, to reduce primary energy consumption by 25% along with a specific target for Public Administration of achieving a reduction of 30%. As part of the plan to use energy from indigenous renewable sources, Portugal aims to have 31% of final gross energy consumption and 10% of energy for transport derived from renewable sources, at the least possible cost the economy. It also aims to reduce the nation's energy dependence and ensure security of supplies, by promoting a balanced energy mix.

The PNAEE and PNAER establish ways of achieving these targets and international commitments with regard to energy efficiency and the use of energy from renewable sources. In addition to intensifying the goals, the plans also identify existing barriers and the potential for improvement with a view to establishing the most suitable programmes and measures for complying with its commitments.

The revision of the PNAEE is based on three lines of intervention: (i) action (suitability of the measures); (ii) monitoring (review of the methods for monitoring results), and (iii) governance (redefining the PNAEE governance model). To this end, an estimated impact analysis was carried out for all the measures in the PNAEE, in accordance with European norms on monitoring energy efficiency plans and measures.

The Resolution aims to operationalise the Energy Efficiency Fund and integrate it with other programmes to support energy efficiency, so as to optimise incentives. The Resolution takes into consideration measures already established by the National Climate Change Programme (PNAC).

The implementation of PNAEE 2016 and PNAER 2020 should benefit from a common structure tracking and monitoring of the progress and results of the measures and actions taken in each Plan. The PNAEE 2016 and PNAER 2020 should also be articulated with the structure of supervision and monitoring of the PNAC in 2020, allowing the provision of information for assessing national commitments energy and climate.

525,Rwanda Vision 2020,"Vision 2020 is a framework for Rwanda's development, presenting the key priorities and providing Rwandans with a guiding tool for the future. It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).<br />
<br />
The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).<br />
<br />
Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.<br />
<br />
To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population.",executive,Rwanda,RWA,,"Transportation, Research And Development, Redd+ And Lulucf, Energy Supply, Energy Demand",01/07/2000 | Law passed

539,National Climate Change Strategy,"The National Climate Change Strategy 2012 (replacing a previous version published in 2008), produced by the National Climate Change Secretariat, provides a comprehensive overview of Singapore's response to climate change. It reiterates the country's pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country's commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore's long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore's position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.<br />
<br />
The strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore's response to climate change:<br />
- Long-term and integrated planning;<br />
- Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and<br />
- Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets.<br />
<br />
It also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change:<br />
- Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors;<br />
- Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change;<br />
- Harnessing green growth opportunities; and<br />
- Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies).<br />
<br />
The document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore's national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country's core strategy (given the country's limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include:<br />
- Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas;<br />
- Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills;<br />
- Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances;<br />
- Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings;<br />
- Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and<br />
- Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies coastline protection, addressing flood risks, and managing water resources as the three key adaptation priorities of Singapore, and also focuses heavily on green growth as a development model.

556,Renewable Energy Act (Act 309/2009 on Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources and High-efficiency Cogeneration and on amendments to certain acts),"The Act is the main instrument to support renewable electricity generation. It defines specific options for support for renewable electricity, including the timeframe of guaranteed price of purchase. It also originally mandated electricity producers with capacity of 50MW to produce electricity with minimum of 20% share of renewable resources.<br />
<br />
Due to its generous feed-in tariffs for solar energy, Slovakia witnessed an unanticipated 'solar boom' in early 2011. As a result, in February 2011, the size of the solar installations eligible for these subsidies was scaled back to 100kW, and feed-in tariffs were nearly halved compared to 2009.<br />
<br />
In August 2012, another amendment changed the conditions for producers of electricity from small solar rooftop installations with installed capacities of up to 10 kW. Operators of these installations may now generate electricity for their own use without having to register as an entrepreneur.<br />
<br />
According to a 2013 amendment, the feed-in tariff will apply only to rooftop photovoltaic installations on with a maximum capacity of 30kW. All larger installations are no longer be covered by the support mechanism. The initial version of the amendment also envisaged promoting high efficiency cogeneration up to an installed capacity of 300MW, but it was eventually revoked.<br />
<br />
Feed-in tariffs are limited to installations producing electricity from renewable energy sources or CHP with installed power up to 5MW (15MW in the case of wind power). The feed-in tariff and other support are provided to electricity producers during 15 years since the commissioning of the installation or its renovation (conditions apply).<br />
<br />
The Act also specifies the quotas for increase in share of biofuels in the transport fuels for individual years between 2011 and 2020. The share of biofuels should reach 8.5% by the end of 2020.<br />
<br />
The Law mandates the Ministry of Economy to set the national target for share of energy from renewable sources in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan.

588,Law 24/2013 on the Electric sector,"This Law repealed Law 54/1997, which previously regulated the sector. The main driver for the law was to reduce the unsustainable tariff deficit of the electricity sector.

A new support scheme for renewable energy sources is planned, based on the direct participation of renewable energy sources in the market, forcing them to compete with traditional sources, although the scheme will allow renewable energies to recover costs that could not be recovered by selling energy on the market. The evaluation of such costs will be based on a theoretical renewable plant and on the average costs incurred by a well-managed company running said installation. Only administrative costs that are uniform at national level will be considered, so administrative costs at regional level are not considered in the framework of the law. The law allows for additional support schemes, but only if they are necessary to achieve European goals. With respect to grid access and grid use, renewables are granted priority connection and priority dispatch - provided that these do not constitute a danger to the grid itself.

Law 24/2013 regulates the economic framework for self-production-and consumption of electricity, a topic that had been in debate for months between different stakeholders. It states that entities that consume the energy they produce will have to make the same contribution to the financing of costs and services of the grid as consumers that take the electricity directly from the grid. This point had been at the centre of the debate and was strongly opposed by renewable energy associations, who thought it would create strong barriers to consumers installing their own renewable generating system. The fine for producers who access the self-consumption scheme incorrectly is set between EUR6m and EUR60m (USD7.53m-USD75.3m).

The laws reverse the phase-out of nuclear power production, repealing the Nuclear Phase-Out Act and the ban on new nuclear power facilities.

The purpose of the law is to allow old nuclear reactors to be replaced with newer, safer models. It also reflects the recent shift towards new carbon technologies as opposed to a stronger expansion of renewable energies classified as counting towards climate mitigation. The Swedish parliament approved the act under the condition that no direct or indirect public funding may be available for the new nuclear power reactors.

Parliament also stipulated that operators of nuclear facilities and the owners of nuclear power reactors carry unlimited liability in the event of a nuclear accident.

603,An Integrated Climate and Energy Policy,"Passed by the Riksdag in 2009, these laws originating in two government bills form the basis of Sweden's flagship climate policy, known as 'an Integrated Climate and Energy Policy.<br />
<br />
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).<br />
<br />
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.<br />

Targets outlined in this legislation include:<br />
- 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)<br />
- 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020<br />
- 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)<br />

604,Action Plan for a fossil-fuel independent vehicle fleet,"Following from Sweden's Integrated Climate and Energy Policy Bills, this action plan sets out the specific measures to achieve the objective of a fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet by 2030. Given that one third of emissions occur in the road-based transportation sector, the fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet is a key contribution to Sweden's GHG emission reduction target.<br />
<br />
The key principle is to put a price on the GHG emissions emitted by the transportation sector and thus encouraging a move towards fossil fuel independent fuels as non-fossil fuel based vehicles are becoming cheaper than fossil fuel based vehicles. This is to be achieved through various policy instruments, measures, initiatives and incentives.<br />
<br />
These include carbon pricing (emission trading, energy and especially carbon taxes) in the transportation sector, increasing the dialogue between the government and the automotive cluster to strengthen its long-term competitiveness and promote greener fuel development and vehicle technology, extension of subsidies to establish filling stations for renewable fuels, increasing the share of biofuels in road transportation fuels via implementing the EU fuel quality directive (up to 10% share of biodiesel in the mixture), the requirement that thesustainability criteria must be fulfilled if the biofuels are to count towards the 10% target of fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020; mandating of binding emission standards for automotive manufacturers at 120gCO2/km for new passenger cars, which will be gradually reduced to 95gCO2/km in 2020; exploring the potential for the use of biogas (e.g. from waste) as transportation fuel, i.e. the development of 2nd generation biofuel via financial support (SEK875m USD118.4m) for biofuel demo-plants and the commercialisation of new energy technology; research and development initiatives to assess the incentives for the emerging electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids market, including appropriate stimulus and raising public awareness via consumer information on vehicle fuel consumption.",executive,Sweden,SWE,,"Transportation, Research And Development, Carbon Pricing",25/12/2009 | Law passed

606,"CO2 Act (Act 641.71, fully revised version)","The CO2 Act is at the core of Swiss climate legislation and has been updated several times, including for meeting Swiss commitments under the UNFCCC.

The most recent version of the CO2 Act is a full revision of the 2000 CO2 Act, which has been partially revised several times, and a response to the need for post-2012 climate legislation until 2020.

The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are:
- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad
- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met
- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.
- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).
- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy
- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects
- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme
- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level

Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading
- Prepare linking with EU ETS
- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%
- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year
- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned
- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products
- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy

Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.

Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme. Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity. These aim at accommodating the 48,000 applications that were received since 2010.

The 2000 CO2 Act focused on meeting the Kyoto Protocol commitment of overall GHG emission reductions of 8% in the 2008 - 2012 period compared to the 1990 base line. The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland's GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000.
Those include:
- CO2 levy for thermal fuels
- Climate cent on transportation fuels
- Voluntary commitments
- Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration
- Use of cap and trade market mechanisms and flexible mechanisms
- Requires the Federal Council to propose further GHG emission reduction targets for period after 2012 leading up to 2020.",legislative,Switzerland,CHE,,"Transportation, Research And Development, Redd+ And Lulucf, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Carbon Pricing, Adaptation",01/01/2013 | Law passed

The main aim of the Act is to contribute to an adequate energy supply - i.e. diversified, safe, economical and compatible with the requirements of environmental protection. Its principal goals include:<br>&nbsp;- ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection<br>&nbsp;- promote the efficient and rational use of energy<br>&nbsp;- encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy.<br>&nbsp;The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders:<br>&nbsp;- The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM).<br>&nbsp;- The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000<br>&nbsp;- Households' final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009).<br>&nbsp;Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Energy Ordinance specifies the provisions of the Energy Act:<br>&nbsp;It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006. The overall funding for available feed-in tariffs is capped in 2015 at approximately CHF580m (USD605.9m), with funds to be distributed among the different types of technologies so as to ensure their parallel development (the entire fund cannot assigned to one single technology).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The making of the New Energy Act started on September 30, 2016, to enhance its previously stated goals over the period until 2035 of a sustainable security of supply, efficiency, reduced overall energy consumption and increase of domestic renewable energy use. The referendum of May 21st, 2017, decided for a ""complete revision"" of the Act that will enter into force on January 1, 2018. Revisions under the new Act include an increased promotion of renewables, which will benefit of a grid fee raised to 2,3 ct./kWh. However, the new system of subsidies is limited to the end of 2022 and plants under 1 MW of capacity won't be accepted anymore. Smart metering systems also get enhanced legal rights. Energy efficiency targets for private motorised vehicles (cars) are indexed to the European Union limits, and subsidies will be included for vehicles emitting less than 50g of CO2 per km will be applied from 2020 to 2022. Furthermore, a complete ban to any further project of nuclear energy is stated.

617,National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation,"The National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation was approved and adopted by the Governmental Decree No.259. The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors.<br />
<br />
The Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health.<br />
<br />
To mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions.<br />
<br />
Principles and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection.",executive,Tajikistan,TJK,,"Research And Development, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation",06/06/2003 | Law passed

646,National Climate Change Policy,"As the document outlines, 'the goal of the policy is to ensure a harmonised and co-ordinated approach towards a climate- resilient and low-carbon development path for sustainable development in Uganda'. The policy notes that the level of knowledge on climate change and its impacts remains low in Uganda. Therefore, it seeks to raise awareness of climate change, targeting sectorial weaknesses (to be determined by different governmental agencies and ministries) in the short term but providing information for a wide variety of stakeholders in the long term.<br />
To this end, the Policy adopts a comprehensive approach to address climate change, identifying as priority concerns: adaptation, mitigation, monitoring, and research. To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building.<br />
The policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables.<br />
The adoption of climate change strategies that address the impact of climate change and promote sustainable activities in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fishery production, water management, forestry, wetland, biodiversity and ecosystem services and tourism are identified are important needs to develop Uganda's approach to adaption to climate change.<br />
Moreover, the Policy also seeks to implement the basic institutional structure required to finance this awareness raising campaign and to develop a performance measurement framework for each ministry and agency involved. The policy also strengthens the Climate Change Unit, upgrading it to a National Climate Change Commission with a more advanced legal and institutional framework that can co-ordinate climate change policy across sectors and regions. The Policy Committee on Environment is also strengthened to help guide climate change policy implementation.<br />

648,The Renewable Energy Policy for Uganda,"The Renewable Energy Policy follows the commitment in the National Energy Policy 2002 to develop the use of renewable energy resources in Uganda. The Government's overarching policy vision for renewable energy is to make modern renewable energy a substantial part of national energy consumption, where modern renewable energy is understood to mean renewable energy resources that are transformed into modern energy services like electricity.<br />
To achieve its goal, a number of supporting objectives are identified. These include: maintaining and improving the responsiveness of the legal and institutional framework to promote renewable energy investments; establishing an financing and fiscal policy framework for investments in renewable energy; increasing public awareness in renewable energy and promoting investment in this area; promoting research and development as well as international co-operation in renewable energy technologies (RETs); utilizing biomass energy efficiently and sustainably; and promoting the conversion of municipal and industrial waste to energy.<br />
Various strategies and policy actions are elaborated in order to achieve these objectives. A power generation programme will support public and private sector investments in renewable energy, focussing on large hydropower schemes (hydropower being the most well developed RET) as well as small and more diverse schemes. A rural and urban-poor electricity access programme will support the development of RETs in dispersed and remote settlements. A modern energy services programme will support RETs such as solar PV and solar water heaters, a biofuels programme will support improvements in biofuel technology, and a waste for energy programmes will support the conversion of waste to energy. An energy efficiency programmes will implement the Uganda Energy Efficiency Strategy.<br />
<br />
The responsibility for the policy lies with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and a Renewable Energy Department is to be developed within the Ministry. Moreover, a special financial mechanism, a credit support facility known as the Uganda Energy Capitalisation Trust, is instituted to help realise the policy. The ultimate goal of the Renewable Energy Policy is to increase the use of modern renewable energy, from the current 4% to 61% of the total energy consumption by the year 2017.",executive,Uganda,UGA,Mitigation and adaptation,"Research And Development, Energy Supply, Energy Demand",29/03/2007 | Law passed

The amendment by Law 601-VI defined green tariff as the special rate to purchase electricity produced by through alternative energy sources. A consumer's body authorised by the Cabinet of Ministers issues a document confirming the purchase of energy generated from alternative energy sources. It also establishes that the wholesale electricity market must buy the green tariff electricity from alternative energy sources, and sell it directly to consumers or energy supplying companies.<br />
<br />
Green tariff is defined as a special tariff for electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy (except blast-furnace and coke gases; with regard to hydropower - at small plants only, i.e. with capacity up to 10 MWel).<br />
<br />
The amended Law obliges the Ukrainian wholesale electricity providers to purchase electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy through the green tariff. The green tariff was planned as a double average tariff for traditional electricity sold on the Ukrainian wholesale market in the year preceding the year of the tariff decision.<br />
<br />
The state regulator (NKRE) defines the Green Tariff based on a formula. Special fed-in (green) tariffs were established for wind, solar, biomass, biogas, small hydro (<10MW) and geothermal power plants. Green Tariffs are fixed until 2030 with guaranteed electricity of-take by the Wholesale Electricity Market Operator. Green Tariffs are revised on a monthly basis to follow changes in UAH/EUR currency exchange rate. Green Tariffs are applied to new construction projects as well as renewable power plants operated before approval of the Law. Reduction of Green Tariffs by 10%, 20% and 30% for RES plants commissioned after 2014, 2019 and 2024 respectively. Local content requirement of 30% starting in July 2013 and 50% starting in July 2014 (for solar, wind and small hydro projects) with additional conditionality.<br />

On 14 September 2017 the National Commission for the State Regulation on Energy and utilities adopted the resolution n.1118 amending the procedure of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and called ""On Approval of the Amendments to the Template Power Purchase Agreement between the State Enterprise ""Energorynok"" and Business Entity that Produces Electricity From Alternative Energy Sources"". The resolution was prepared in cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corportation.<br />
<br />
The PPA is the procedure relating suppliers of green electricity and the State Enterprise Energorynok, which has a statutory obligation to purchase all electricity from renewable sources due to Law 5485-VI on green tariff (feed-in-tariff). This resolution introduces significant measures aimed at strengthening the investments in the renewable energy sector. It notably adds the possibility for market players to go to the International Criminal Court once a dispute has been dealt with by a competent commercial court in Ukraine, or if the given court has recused itself. However, the wording of the amendment does not ensure that this procedure will effectively be used. It also details grounds for payments, specifies the obligation to send hourly data directly through the system NEC ""Ukrenergo"", expands the list of circumstances deemed as a force majeure event, and extends the PPA after the liquidation of Energorynok.

The Plan sets out how the UK will achieve decarbonisation within the framework of energy policy - making a transition to a low carbon economy while maintaining energy security and minimising costs to consumers (particularly those in poorer households).<br />
<br />
The Plan sets out proposals and policies to meet the UK's first four carbon budgets, each lasting five years with increasing emissions reductions targets. The fourth budget, for the period 2023-2027, requires emissions to be reduced by 50% compared to 1990 levels.<br />
<br />
The plan includes 5 sectoral plans, covering measures to be taken during this decade and in the 2020s:<br />
- Low carbon buildings, including energy efficiency and low carbon heating<br />
- Low carbon transport<br />
- Low carbon industry<br />
- Low carbon electricity<br />
- Agriculture, land use, forestry and waste<br />

664,Climate Change Act,"<div>The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target. The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability.&nbsp;<br><br>The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period). The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set.&nbsp;<br><br>The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste. The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping.&nbsp;<br><br>The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks. The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work. ****** The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels.

Even though the requirement for the Home Information Pack for property sales was suspended in 2010, an Energy Performance Certificate is still required.<br />
<br />
There are six levels of the Code, with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency at each level. Level 1 represents a 10% improvement in energy efficiency over the 2006 Building Regulations. Level 6 would be a completely zero-carbon home (heating, lighting, hot water and all appliances).<br />
<br />
Improvements in the energy efficiency of new homes of more than 25% compared to 2006 regulations (Level 3 of the code) would probably require some form of low- or zero-carbon energy generation, either by individual buildings (eg dedicated solar water heating) or by whole developments sharing a source of low carbon generation (eg wind turbines).",executive,United Kingdom,GBR,No,Energy Demand,25/12/2006 | Law passed

669,Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme,"Supports biomass-fuelled heat, and CHP projects in the industrial, commercial and community sectors in England. Six rounds of funding have been provided since the Scheme was launched in 2002. Earlier rounds focused support on large-scale biomass power stations. The emphasis in later rounds has been to support small- and medium-sized projects.<br />
<br />
The Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme promotes the efficient use of biomass for energy, and in particular the use of energy crops by stimulating the early deployment of biomass-fuelled heat and electricity generation projects. It awards capital grants towards the cost of installing equipment in complete biomass-fuelled projects in the industrial, commercial and community sectors.<br />
<br />
The main policy aims of the Scheme are to:<br />
- Deliver capacity to create an initial market for biomass fuel, installation equipment and services<br />
- To stimulate the UK renewables industry<br />
- Provide learning benefits that will accelerate the industry and achieve more efficient and cost effective use of biomass for heat and electricity.",executive,United Kingdom,GBR,,Energy Supply,25/12/2002 | Law passed
670,Company Car Tax Reform,"In 2002, the UK Company Car Tax system was revised to be carbon-based. All company cars first registered after January 1998 are taxed on a percentage of their list price according to CO2 emission bands, measured in grams per kilometre (g/km).<br />
<br />
The reform was intended to remove the perverse incentive in the existing system to reduce the tax due by driving unnecessary extra business miles and to provide a significant incentive to company cars drivers to choose more fuel-efficient vehicles.<br />
<br />
To further promote environmentally friendly vehicles, the government introduced a progressive percentage charge rate system. This system has evolved over time - as of 2011, the charge is 0% for care with zero emissions, rising stepwise to a maximum of 35% for emissions of 225g/km and higher.",legislative,United Kingdom,GBR,,"Transportation, Energy Demand",25/12/2002 | Law passed

672,Renewables Obligation,"The Renewables Obligation (RO) is the current main mechanism for supporting large-scale generation of renewable electricity. It has been subject to various reforms and improvements. It is a market-based mechanism, designed to provide a substantial incentive for all eligible forms of renewable electricity.<br />
<br />
The RO places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources, or pay a penalty. The obligation for 2009/10 was 9.7%, rising to 15.4% by 2015/6.<br />
<br />
Previously, one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) was issued for each MWh of eligible generation, regardless of technology. In 2009, reforms gave new generators joining the RO different numbers of ROCs, depending on the costs and potential for large-scale deployment. New projects in more expensive technologies like offshore wind now receive more support and those that are more economic, like landfill gas, receive less.<br />
<br />
Generators can sell their ROCs to electricity supply companies, which use them to demonstrate compliance with the Obligation. This enables generators to receive a premium on top of the sale of the electricity. In 2010, further changes included the RO being extended from its current end date of 2027 to 2037 for new projects, in order to provide greater long-term certainty for investors, and an increase in support for offshore wind projects meeting certain criteria.<br />
<br />
The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RO. Their functions include accrediting renewable generators and the issuing of ROCs.",legislative,United Kingdom,GBR,,Energy Supply,25/12/2002 | Law passed
673,Climate Change Agreements,"Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) are voluntary agreements allow energy intensive business users to receive a discount from the Climate Change Levy of up to 90% of the Levy, in return for meeting energy efficiency or carbon saving targets. (There is also a 100% exemption from the Levy for certain energy-intensive metallurgical and mineralogical industries.)<br />
<br />
The first agreements ran from 2001 to 31 March 2013, and the second CCA scheme runs from 1 April 2013 to 21 December 2023. In 2004, the eligibility criteria for the UK's Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) were extended to cover other energy intensive sectors of industry not originally included within the arrangements for CCAs. Those sectors already eligible for CCAs were unaffected by the changes. CCA targets have been agreed with 53 industrial sectors across more than 9000 sites.<br />
<br />
It was announced in 2007 that the CCA scheme would be extended by 4 years to 2017, subject to state aid approval. This is to provide industry with greater certainty for the medium term, and enable CCAs to continue to contribute significantly to the UK's Climate Change Programme.",legislative,United Kingdom,GBR,No,Energy Demand,01/04/2001 | Law passed ; 25/12/2014 | Last amendment
674,Climate Change Levy,"The Levy applies to electricity, gas, solid fuel and liquefied gases used for lighting, heating and power in the business and public sectors.

The Levy was designed to be broadly revenue neutral in concept: at the time of introduction it formed part of a 'Levy Package' where the revenue collected is recycled back to business through a 0.3% reduction in National Insurance Contributions and also a system of enhanced capital allowances for investments in energy saving technologies.

Electricity produced from qualifying renewable sources and energy used and generated in approved combined heat and power schemes are no longer exempt from the levy.

There is also a reduced (20%) rate for energy-intensive businesses that enter into voluntary agreements to reduce their energy use and/or emissions.

The Climate Change Levy was amended on February 1st 2018.

The Amendment Act makes a number of important changes directly relevant to climate change.It includes a definition of climate change ('a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods', page 3), adds the concept of ecosystem services and processes to the Act, and applies the precautionary principle to any decision made regarding the environment that may risk human health or threaten damage to the environment. It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues.<br />
<br />
The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu's obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation.<br />

The definition of forestry right includes a carbon sequestration right which is defined as â€˜a right conferred by agreement or otherwise to the legal, commercial or other benefit (whether present or future) of carbon sequestration by any existing or future tree or forest on the land'. The Act therefore establishes a separate property right that enables carbon rights to be decoupled from land rights (and thus provides for the allocation of carbon rights). However, while almost all land in Vanuatu is held under customary tenure, only approximately 9% is leased, with a further 90% unleased. Therefore the majority of landholders will not be able to exercise similar rights to forest carbon.<br />

<li> to stimulate sustainable economic growth by promoting competition, efficiency and investment in the sector (applicability and accountability);</li>
<li> to improve the institutional framework and governance in the energy sector (accountability);</li>
<li> to promote research and development in the energy sector (applicability);</li>
<li> to develop the use of other renewable energy sources of energy to complement conventional sources of energy (applicability and acceptability).</li>
</ul>
The policy objective is to create and promote a conductive environment for energy sector players to be able to identify ad develop opportunities for energy supply that promote sustainable development.

The demand side section of the policy highlights the issues in the context of the five demand sectors: agriculture, industry and mining, commerce and services, transport and households (both urban and rural). Focuses include the efficient use of energy in carrying out economic activities and promoting of fuel-wood substation. The supply side refers to the use of coal, petroleum products, electricity, gas and renewable energy. It calls for the sustainable use of biomass resources (e.g. wood fuel, industrial waste such as bagasse and pulp), hydropower, solar power and wind power. Hydropower is currently contributing to the national grid, and the document identifies its potential contribution to rural power needs.

715,Cameroon Vision 2035,"This document presents Cameroon's overall policy direction in pursuit of development. General objectives are: reducing poverty to minimal levels; becoming a middle-income country; becoming a newly industrialised country; and consolidating democracy and enhancing national unity. It was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development.<br />
<br />
Climate change is identified in Vision 2035 as one of the two major challenges to Cameroon's economy. Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals.<br />
<br />
Under the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027). Specific actions include protecting and ensuring sustainable management of forest ecosystems, fighting desert encroachment and promoting regional projects like the Niger Basin and the Lake Chad Basin.Diversification of energy source and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy supplies is mentioned in the document without quantitative targets.",executive,Cameroon,CMR,,"Redd+ And Lulucf, Energy Supply, Adaptation",01/06/2009 | Law passed
716,Document CONPES 3700 on the Institutional Strategy for the Articulation of Policies and Actions in Climate Change,"The main objective of CONPES 3700 is to outline a mechanism for institutional co-ordination to incorporate climate change into sectorial and territorial decision making, the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA).<br />
<br />
CONPES 3700 recommended the creation of SISCLIMA as the official national institution to coordinate and propel climate change actions. Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment.<br />
<br />
The proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues. The final structure however is still under revision.<br />
<br />
A Presidential Decree is required to give effect to CONPES 3700. At the time of writing (November 2014) this has not been issued and meanwhile successive drafts of the REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) have introduced further refinements. For example, CONPES 3700 envisages that SISCLIMA will be directed by an Executive Committee (COMECC). The latest drafts of the R-PP have sought to make SISCLIMA's governance more inclusive; COMECC has now become an Inter-Sectoral Committee (COMICC).",executive,Colombia,COL,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements,14/07/2011 | Law passed

It covers a large scope of economic activities and brings in binding energy targets for transport, housing sector and renewable energy. In its 215 articles, the law sets the following ambitious national targets:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>cut GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 and by 75% by 2050;</li><li>cut the national energy usage by at least 50% by 2050;</li><li>reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production by 30% compared to 2012;</li><li>cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from the current 75% to 50% by 2030;</li><li>bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix by 2030.</li></ul><div><br>&nbsp;The law also increases the carbon tax on fossil fuel more than four times, from the 2015 rate of â‚¬14.5 to â‚¬56 per ton in 2020, and â‚¬100 in 2030, pending on ratification in the annual budget.<br>&nbsp;Renewable energy production is supported through simplified administrative procedures for onshore wind farms (art 143) and general permitting process for renewables (art 145). In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194).<br>&nbsp;The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy).<br>&nbsp;The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of communal parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tenants (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26).<br>&nbsp;The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). Additional measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); penalties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66).<br>&nbsp;The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and institutional investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the financing of the ecological and energy transition. Several other educational and financial assistance projects are to be commissioned to assist citizens with energy efficient retrofits, renewable sources installation and others.<br>&nbsp;The law also promotes waste reduction and resources savings, in particular a gradual decoupling between France's growth and consumption of raw materials. The laws includes the following provisions:<br>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>increase by 30% over 2010-2030, the ratio of the GDP to domestic material consumption;</li><li>decrease the domestic material consumption per capita (consumer products, food waste, electronic waste) and increase recycling rates (art 70-V, art 84, art 87, art 99 and 103);</li><li>the production, distribution, sale, provision and use of packaging or bags made wholly or partly from oxo-fragmentable plastic (biodegradable but not compostable) are prohibited;</li><li>as of 1 January 2016, disposable plastic bags available at supermarket counters are prohibited, and from 1 January 2017, the ""fruit and vegetables"" plastic bags are prohibited (art 75);</li><li>as of 1 January 2017, the use of non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic packaging for sending addressed or non-addressed press and advertising is prohibited ;&nbsp;</li><li>state services and local authorities are to decrease their office paper consumption by 30% before 2020;</li><li>as of 1 January 2017, at least 25% (40% as of 1 January 2020) of paper products, stationery and fiber-based prints acquired by state services and local authorities and their groupings are to be made from recycled paper, with the rest to come from sustainably managed forests;</li><li>strengthened powers for mayors to deal with abandoned vehicles (art 77);</li><li>better monitoring of waste (art 82) and fight against chemical waste trafficking (art 77-IV) and unregulated waste disposal (art 78);</li><li>other quantified limits apply to State and local authorities construction work waste and raw materials use.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The law also aims to support protection of biodiversity and pollution reduction, in particular through mandated reduction of free sale of pesticides for home-gardeners (from 1 January 2016) and then phase-out from 1 January 2017, and ban on aerial spraying of pesticides, except in cases of serious health hazard (art 68).</div>",legislative,France,FRA,No,"Transportation, Redd+ And Lulucf, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Carbon Pricing",17/08/2015 | Law passed |  |

It also specifies the authorities responsible for the management of fuels and energy. Among others, it established the basis for independent electricity and gas production and access of independent power producers to the grid, principles for least cost and integrated resource planning, support to high efficiency heat and power production, demand side management and energy efficiency labels.<br>&nbsp;It facilities the production of electricity from renewable energy sources (up to 5MW), making them eligible to benefit from a reduced grid connection fee and exempt from paying annual licence fees. Energy providers are allowed to incorporate costs of developing renewable energy into their tariff regimes. Since 1 October 2005, energy enterprises that generate, trade or purchase electricity are obliged to purchase or generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources of energy. The obligation will be met through the acquisition and redemption of certificates of origin that certify electricity produced from renewable sources. Transmissions and distribution operators are obliged to accept renewable sources of energy. Similar scheme for heat produced from renewable energy sources entered into force on 1 January 2007.<br>&nbsp;The amendment of 26 July of 2013 simplified the setting up a micro-installation (renewable energy sources with no more than 40kW of total installed electrical capacity, connected to electrical grid of a voltage lower than 110kV or no more than 120 kW of total installed heat capacity). Applications to connect a micro-installation to the grid will no longer be subject to a connection fee nor required to attach documents confirming the admissibility of locating the installation in the investment area.

The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020.
The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO).
The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power).
The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply:

725,Royal Decree 900/2015 on Energy Self-Consumption,"The Royal Decree seeks to promote economically sustainable distributed generation and the use of renewable energies, but also introduces charges and tolls for grid access, with the goal of fair burden-sharing among electricity grid users.<br />
All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).<br />
There are two self-consumption modalities:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li><br />
<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.<br />
All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.<br />
Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid. This prohibits individual small self-consumers from receiving compensation for any self-generated and unused electricity, unless they register as electricity production businesses.",executive,Spain,ESP,Mitigation,"Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand",09/10/2015 | Law passed

727,National Climate Change Response Strategy,"The National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) provides a framework for a comprehensive and strategic approach to climate change adaptation, mitigation, technology and finance. The objective of the Strategy is to 'mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in economic and social development at national and sectoral levels through multi-stakeholder engagement'.<br />
The Strategy mainly aims to help the country and its citizens to adapt to severe droughts, increasing temperatures, irregular rainfall patterns and food shortages, attributed in part to climate change effects.<br />
The risks and impacts of climate change are analysed in the NCCRS, followed by sectoral strategies (agriculture, energy, water, etc.), with varying implementation timeframes. The seven pillars of climate change responses are:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>adaptation and disaster risk management</li><br />
<li>mitigation and low carbon development strategies</li><br />
<li>capacity</li><br />
<li>governance framework</li><br />
<li>finance and investment</li><br />
<li>technology development and transfer, including infrastructure</li><br />
<li>communication and advocacy</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Plan also recommends establishing a National Climate Fund to tackle the impacts of climate change, with need for financing evaluated at more than USD 9.9 billion over the next 5 to 10 years",executive,Zimbabwe,ZWE,,"Research And Development, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation",19/11/2019 | Law passed
728,Energy Transition Law,"The Energy Transition Act's purpose is to promote sustainable and efficient use of energy, regulate the obligations of power companies related to the mandatory share of clean energies (including natural gas, and CCS with emissions not exceeding 100 kg/MWh), and push for the reduction of the polluting emissions of the electric power industry while ensuring competitiveness of the clean power sector within the new wholesale electricity market.<br />
According to the law, the Secretariat of Energy (SENER) should promote generation of clean power to reach the levels set forth in the Climate Change Act for the electric power industry, including: a minimum share of clean energies in power generation of 25 % by 2018, 30 % by 2021, 35 % by 2024.<br />
SENER is also responsible for establishing obligations for mandatory acquisition of clean energy certificates that the suppliers and qualified users participating in the wholesale power market and the holders of interconnection agreements must comply with on an annual basis. The issuance of clean energy certificates (CECs) is expected to begin from 2018 and will serve both as a green incentive and a regulatory mechanism to meet the country's clean energy goals. A transitory provision, valid for four years, allows companies to defer 50 % of their CEC acquisition obligation for two years under specific conditions.<br />
The law also establishes the National Commission for Efficient Use of Energy (CONUEE), tasked with promoting energy efficiency, providing scientific advice in matters of clean energy, and drafting the Energy Strategy that sets medium and long term goals (15 and 30 years horizon respectively) as well as the National Programme for Sustainable Use of Energy (PRONASE - Chapter V of the Energy Transition Act), the two main implementation tools of the law.<br />
The law further establishes a Smart Grid Programme to promote grid modernization to maintain a reliable and secure infrastructure to meet electricity demand in an economically efficient and sustainable manner.<br />
The Act also stipulates that costs previously externalised (including health and environmental impacts) are now to be included in evaluation of costs associated with operation and expansion of the Electricity Industry.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Act abrogates the Law for the Use of Renewable Energies and the Financing of the Energy Transition (LAERFTE 2008), the Law for the Sustainable Use of Energy (LASE 2008) and any related legal provisions opposing this new Act. The funds from the Energy Transition Fund established by LAERFTE are to be transferred to the Federal Budget and redirected as new funds for energy transition and sustainable energy use.<br />

The Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MEER) oversees renewable energy policy and planning. The generation, transmission, distribution and commercialisation of electricity are defined as public service, to be provided primarily by the public sector, under the guidance of the newly created Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL - previously National Electricity Board CONELEC). Transmission and distribution of electricity is under the responsibility of state-(majority)-owned companies. Private entities may build and operate power plants and transmission and distribution lines, as long as their generated power does not exceed 50MW.
The law also provides for preferential regulations for renewable energy, in particular prioritizing rural-electrification projects. The Electricity Master Plan and the National Energy Efficiency Plan are to be developed by MEER.

733,"Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016","The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on 18 December 2015, renews tax credit programs for wind and solar electricity generation and incorporates a phase-out schedule for these support programs, providing some stability for the renewable energy market.<br />
The Act extends the 'production tax credit' (PTC) for wind facilities provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code per kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity production for facilities beginning construction before 1 January 2020. This change applies retroactively from 1 January 2015 (when the previous guarantee for PTC originally expired). The Act also includes a phase-out provision, under which the volume of PTC depends on beginning of the construction of the wind facilities: 20% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2017, 40% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2018, and 60% reduction of PTC if construction begins in 2019.<br />
The Act allows wind facilities brought into service before 1 January 2020 to choose the 'investment tax credit' (ITC) program, based upon a percentage of each energy property brought into service during any taxable year, instead of the PTC program. The ITC program applies similar percentage-based phase-out support as the PTC program.<br />
The Act extends the ITC program for solar energy until 2021, with a percentage-based phase-out provision. The energy credit reduces from 30% to 26% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2019 and further to 22% percent for facilities upon which construction begins after 31 December 2020. It is estimated that the solar ITC provision of the Act will add '220,000 new jobs by 2020, cut 100 million tons of emissions, and lead to $133 billion invested in the U.S. economy' (http://www.seia.org/news/seia-celebrates-extension-itc).",legislative,United States of America,USA,No,"Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply",18/12/2015 | Law passed

<li> reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and</li><br />
<li> ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable"" (Art 3).</li><br />
</ul><br />
These objectives are to be reached through issuing of certificates for the generation of electricity, with two types of renewable energy certificates:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>large?scale generation certificates, created in relation to the generation of electricity by accredited power stations; and</li><br />
<li>small?scale technology certificates, created in relation to the installation of solar water heaters and small generation units (Art 17B).</li><br />
</ul><br />
The certificates can only be issued for eligible renewable energy sources, including hydro, wave, tide, ocean, wind, solar, geothermal?aquifer, hot dry rock, energy crops, wood waste, agricultural waste, waste from processing of agricultural products, food waste, food processing waste, bagasse, black liquor, biomass?based components of municipal solid waste, landfill gas, sewage gas and biomass?based components of sewage, and any other energy source prescribed by the regulations. (Art 17).<br />
Certain purchasers (called liable entities) are required to surrender a specified number of certificates for the electricity that they acquire during a year.<br />
Liable entity is defined as ""a person who, during a year, makes a relevant acquisition (wholesale acquisition or wholesale notional acquisition - <em>author's note</em>) of electricity"" (Art 35). Exemption applies if:<br />
<br />
<ol><br />
<li> ""the electricity was delivered on a grid that has a capacity that is less than 100 MW and that is not, directly or indirectly, connected to a grid that has a capacity of 100 MW or more; or</li><br />

741,13th Five-Year Plan,"The 13th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2016-2020 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. It gives top priority to economic development to reach a GDP growth rate of 6.5-7% per annum, consistent with the goal of becoming a 'moderately prosperous society' by 2020, guided by five key principles of 'innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development'. At the same time, the 13th Five Year Plan sets peak targets for carbon emissions and energy and water consumption, as well as goals for increasing efficiency of industries and eliminating outdated or overcapacity production facilities, increasing energy production from renewables, and developing green infrastructure. It follows the 11th Five Year Plan, which implemented the concept of energy intensity targets in a number of pilot projects, and the 12th Five Year Plan, which broadened the nature of economic growth towards social inclusiveness and sustainability.<br />
<br />
<strong>Carbon Emissions</strong><br />
<br />
China aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18% from 2015 levels by 2020, in line with China's pledge at the COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, where President Xi Jinping affirmed China's commitment to reduce total carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from 2005 levels by 2030 and peak carbon emissions by 2030.<br />
<br />
The 13th Five-Year Plan also tasks the government with developing rules and regulations to manage the national carbon trading program to be developed based on expansion of the existing seven pilot schemes and expected to be launched around 2018.<br />
<br />
<strong>Energy </strong><br />
<br />
China aims to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 15% from 2015 levels by 2020 (compared to the 16% set in 12th Five-Year Plan 2011-2015, which eventually delivered a reduction of about 18.2%). This more conservative goal is consistent with the estimated 6.5%-7% GDP growth rate projected for 2016-2021, which is slower than the 7% growth rate targeted in the 12th Five-Year Plan. To reach this target, the 13th Five Year Plan specifies sectoral targets and milestones. First, it sets a further goal to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by at least an additional 3.4% in 2016. Second, it caps China's total energy consumption at 5 billion metric tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020, a 16.3% increase in consumption from 2015 levels.<br />
<br />
To reach these goals, China's energy production mix is set to diversify and shift away from coal and towards greater proportion of renewables. China is increasing the efficiency of coal burning power plants and also plans to shut down coal-fired boilers that fail to meet national standards, and has restricted construction of new coal-fired power plants. The Plan also supports increase in renewable energy capacity and connection through national government support for wind, solar, and biomass energy production. The Government will also continue to invest in new hydropower, energy storage and nuclear power projects, as well as further increase in the network of smart grids and ultra high-voltage power transmission.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transportation</strong><br />
<br />
The transportation measures and goals in the 13th Five Year Plan are closely related to addressing air pollution, in order to ""maintain acceptable air quality levels in major cities for 80% of days by the end of 2020"". The Plan aims to expand the electric vehicle market, by constructing dedicated parking lots and charging facilities, and removing almost 4 million high-emission vehicles from roads. The Plan will continue to support adoption of low-emission ""new energy vehicles"" through subsidies to automakers, local governments for purchase of green fleets, and tax breaks and free registration for consumers.<br />
<br />
<strong>REDD+ and LULUCF</strong><br />
<br />
The 13th Five Year Plan also aims to modernize commercial agriculture production to reduce overcapacity, while aiming to turn 1 million hectares of marginal cropland into forest or grassland. In an effort to reduce air pollution, the Plan also aims to increase forest coverage to 23.04% over the next five years.",executive,China,CHN,,"Transportation, Redd+ And Lulucf, Energy Supply, Energy Demand",16/03/2016 | Law passed

The law supports a broad variety of power generation options, including oil, coal and natural gas, hydroelectric power, wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable sources of power, as well as energy efficiency and distribution and transmission systems upgrades. The Electricity Africa Act however particularly promotes renewable energy projects, as the law requires the U.S. government to promote the spread of distributed renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa, including off-grid lighting and power. The priority given to off-grid generation is an endorsement of existing efforts, already carried out by a sub-initiative of Power Africa Initiative (see below).<br />
To create lasting infrastructures, the law seeks to promote policies to facilitate private financing and public-private partnerships, allow independent producers' participation in electricity markets, and encourage other regulatory reforms in the power sector. The law calls on the US to partner with sub-Saharan African countries, international and regional financial institutions and the private sector to meet the above goals and implement a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.<br />

764,Fundamental Law on Energy Policy (Basic Act on Energy Policy) and its Strategic Plans (Law No. 71 of 2002),"A lawmaker-initiated legislation, this Law sought to set out the country's fundamental and overall energy policy direction after the approval of the Diet. It sets the principles on the use of market mechanisms to encourage a secure and more environmentally friendly supply of energy. It provides that the State has a responsibility to create overarching energy plans ('Strategic Energy Plan', or 'Basic Energy Plan') and commit to reducing environmental impacts. The role of subnational governments is to implement the national measures in own jurisdiction.<br />
A Strategic Energy Plan sets out basic energy measures, long-term and comprehensive measures and research and development needed to achieve the above. The Plan is sent to discussion and adoption by the Diet, and to date four plans have been adopted (October 2003, March 2007, June 2010, April 2014).<br />
The Fourth Strategic Energy Plan (April 2014) added safety into the basic policy perspective, on top of the 3 elements ('the 3Es') mentioned in the previous plans: energy security, economic efficiency and environment (collectively known as '3E+S'). Diversification of energy sources and flexible and efficient energy demand structure are the two basic pillars of energy policy, reflecting the learning from the 2011 energy crisis. Promotion of resilient energy supply structure and improvement of self-sufficiency of energy supply are emphasised as national interest for energy policy.<br />
In particular, the Fourth Strategic Energy Plan sets the following targets:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Efficient lighting equipment (e.g. LED lighting and organic EL lighting): target ""penetration rate of 100% on a flow basis by 2020 and on a stock basis by 2030"" (page 39)</li><br />
<li>Low-emission vehicles: target increase in the ""ratio of next-generation vehicles to all new vehicles to 50%-70% by 2030 while promoting comprehensive measures, including steps to improve traffic flow such as the development of loop routes and other trunk road networks and introduction of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which will contribute to energy efficiency' (page 40)</li><br />
<li>Storage batteries: promote introduction by ""lowering their cost and improving their performance through technological development and international standardization so that Japanese companies related to the storage battery business will capture a share of 50% in the global storage battery market (20 trillion yen) by 2020' (page 76)</li><br />

The most recent Commercial Buildings Disclosure Programme, updated over June-September 2016, lowered the mandatory disclosure threshold on commercial office buildings from 2,000 to 1,000 square meters. This should see an additional 1,000 commercial buildings now disclose their energy efficiency when they sell or lease their property and aims to deliver more than $50 million in energy savings, and approximately 3.5 million tonnes of emission reductions over five years. Disclosure changes will commence 1 July 2017.<br />
In relation to lowering the threshold, the frequency of required tenancy lighting assessment was lowered, to every five years instead of each year. This provision entered into effect as of September 1st 2016.<br />
Heavy financial penalties apply for non-compliance. The aim of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act is to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's large office buildings by helping to provide buyers and tenants with credible, comparable energy efficiency information to take into account in their market decisions.

776,"Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG, latest version EEG 2017)","This Act (introduced in 2000, amended since) replaced the law on feeding electricity from renewable resources into the public grid of 1990. The Act has set a goal of generating 35% of electricity supply from renewable energy resources by 2020 (amended from 30% after the Fukushima disaster). Longer term targets include the share of renewable electricity at 40-45% by 2025, 55-60% by 2035 and 80% by 2050.<br />
<br />
The main features of the last three amendments are specified below:<br />
The 2012 amendment (Act amending the regulatory framework for electricity from PV) introduced monthly tariff degressions in the national feed-in tariff (FiT), replacing the annual FiT cut that typically occurs in January. A EUR50m (USD62.7m) research and development programme for PV storage solutions was also established, started in January 2013.<br />
The 2014 amendment introduced four major changes:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>A deployment corridor for wind, photovoltaics and biomass was set in order to avoid overshoots;</li><br />
<li>Direct marketing is now mandatory for all new installations (with minor exceptions);</li><br />
<li>It lays the foundation for tendering of support from 2017 onwards;</li><br />
<li>It removes several subsidies and exemption for energy-intensive consumers and 'prosumers'.</li><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>introduction of an auction system for nearly all renewable energy sources (onshore wind, offshore wind, photovoltaic and biomass); installations of ?750kW (for biomass of ?150kW) will be exempt from auctions and remunerated as previously;</li><br />
<li>the already existing auction scheme for ground mounted PV solar systems will be extended to also cover rooftop plants and installations on other structures;</li><br />
<li>the permitted areas for PV solar installations will now also include commercial and industrial property, areas with a plan approval decision or projects which are, subject to further requirements, located in 'disadvantaged areas';</li><br />
<li>onshore wind: in 2017, 2018 and 2019, 2,800MW and from 2020, 2,900MW (gross) will be auctioned each year; and</li><br />
<li>offshore wind: up to 2030, offshore wind farms will be installed with a total capacity of 15,000 MW; the ""central â€˜Danish' target model"" will be introduced (the Government examines in advance the sites to be auctioned for wind farms to ensure optimal dovetailing with the grid connections and avoid a stock of grid connections having to be built and resulting in significant extra costs).</li><br />

First, the precautionary principle is included in art. 4.8). Section XIII, dedicated to climate change management, grants the executive power the mission to formulate and foster an adaptation policy that would also comprise mitigation targets.

This adaptation policy should in particular 1) Promote the adaptation mechanisms of vulnerable populations, through the implementation of plans and strategies at the regional and national levels, 2) Strengthen institutional capacities and groups of key actors in the management of climate change, and assess the vulnerability and adaptation of prioritized human systems to climate change, variability, risks and extreme events, 3) Develop capacities for a better understanding and knowledge of the effects of climate change on human systems, in order to develop and prioritize adaptation measures, 4) Promote and support the availability and exchange of information among the different national sectors, as well as the dissemination and awareness to the public, on climate change issues, 5) Contribute to the monitoring, monitoring and evaluation of climate variability in the different human systems and of socioeconomic interest for the country, and 6) Contribute to the mitigation of the phenomenon of climate change, using the mechanisms created by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",legislative,Nicaragua,NIC,No,"Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Adaptation",27/03/1996 | Law passed ; 13/02/2008 | Law amended

The Strategy seeks in particular to:

1) raise the level of awareness of the community at all levels on the opportunities and threats brought by climate change,

2) enhance the capacity of the community for designing and taking appropriate measures on climate change adaptation,

3) enable the community to benefit in climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable development,

4) enable the community share best practices and lessons learned from adaptation and mitigation to climate change,

5) better coordinate the various information flows and information networks amongst the various stakeholders to better address adaptation needs and participate in mitigation opportunities for the benefit of the country,

6) forge well informed partnerships and networks to ensure a win-win situation amongst the private sector, academia, research institutions, government organs and other actors within and outside the country, and

7) equip Tanzanians and other climate change actors and decision makers engaged at the technical and policy level with timely and relevant information they can use in making informed decisions and choice.

975,"National Energy Policy, 2015","The National Energy Policy (NEP) was updated in December 2015 by the Ministry of Energy and Minerals. It aims at sustainably providing adequate, reliable and affordable energy to the Tanzanians. The NEP notably aims at scaling up the utilisation of renewable energy per se and to diversify the country's energy mix, using solar, biomass, wind, small-scale hydro and geothermal, including in buildings and industrial designs. Feed-in tariffs should be established and renewable energy integrate both the national and isolated grids. Alternatives to wood for cooking are also promoted. Besides, the document calls for a controlled use of new petroleum discoveries in the country.<br />
<br />
In terms of energy efficiency in the sectors of industry, residential commercial, agro-based, and transport, the NEP aims at 1) facilitating the establishment of standards and code of practice for energy management, 2) ensure energy uses are benchmarked to industry prudent practices, 3) facilitate efficient biomass conversion and end-use technologies, and 4) ensure the integration of energy efficiency aspects in housing policies and building codes.<br />
<br />
In transport, the NEP promotes a fuel switch to other forms of energy such as electricity, ethanol and compressed natural gas.<br />
<br />
The document also aims at strengthening institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks and developing human resource to ensure development of a sustainable Energy Sector, and promotes compliance with environmental, health and safety standards in the Energy Sector.",executive,Tanzania,TZA,,"Transportation, Research And Development, Institutions / Administrative Arrangements, Energy Supply, Energy Demand",01/12/2015 | Law passed
976,National Five Year Development Plan 2016/17 - 2020/21,"The National Five Year Development Plan released in 2016 by the Ministry of Finance and Planning is a broad document setting the government's vision for development over the period 2016/17 to 2020/21. It identifies climate change as a further challenge to successfully implement development policies, notably due to induced distractions of infrastructure, loss of productivity in agriculture, and disease outbreaks. Both mitigation and adaptation are explicit policy goals, including supporting research programs to improve and develop new technologies, agronomic practices, information collection and dissemination for early warning.<br />
<br />
The document promotes renewable energy technologies, including biogas, liquefied petroleum gas, solar energy as well as geothermal and wind. It further acknowledges that alternative sources of renewable energy production are being developed, which is an encouraging trend given the increasing unpredictability of weather and the growing negative impact of climate change for hydro generation.<br />
<br />
Key targets to attain by 2020 include 1) accrued share of GDP to 10 % obtained from sustainable forestry, water and marine resources, 2) proportion of energy derived from renewable energy to 50 %, 3) increased natural forest cover by 130,000 Ha, and 100 million trees planted country wide, 4) 60% reduction in charcoal consumption in urban areas, 5) increasing the proportion of districts with climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies to 60%.<br />

It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets.<br />
<br />
The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million.<br />
<br />
The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers. The decision also charges the Finance Minister in concentration with the Energy Minister to consider an update in tax policy regarding the deprecation for energy-saving products. Photovoltaic commercial facilities in particular will be granted a tax benefit in form of an accelerated depreciation at a 20 % rate over a three-year period.<br />

1288,Law no 1/2005 regulating the greenhouse gas emission rights trading scheme and creating the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission (CCPCC),"Law 1/2005 translates EU regulations related to the GHG emission rights trading scheme. It further creates the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission (CCPCC) as a coordination and collaboration body between the General State Administration and the Autonomous Communities for the application of the trade regime of rights of issue and compliance with international and community information obligations inherent to it.

Royal Decree 1823/2011, which restructures the ministerial departments, establishes that the chair of the Commission corresponds to the Secretary of State for the Environment.

The functions entrusted to the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission are the following: 1) the monitoring of climate change and adaptation to its effects, 2) the prevention and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 3) the promotion of carbon absorption capacity by plant formations, 4) taking into account the criteria established by the National Climate Council, the establishment of the general lines of action of the National Authority Designated by Spain and the criteria for the approval of mandatory reports on voluntary participation in clean development projects and of joint application of the Kyoto Protocol, 5) the promotion of programs and actions that encourage the reduction of emissions in the sectors and activities not included in the scope of Law 1/2005, 6) the elaboration and approval of technical guidelines and explanatory notes for the harmonization of the application of the emission rights regime, and 7) the development and implementation of a national regime of domestic projects.

The purpose of the Royal Decree No. 1.315 / 2005, taken in order to apply the 2005 law, is to establish the basic rules to be followed by the systems for monitoring and verifying greenhouse gas emissions from authorised facilities in accordance with the law regulating the regime for the trading of gas emission rights Greenhouse.

The purpose of Royal Decree No. 1.264 / 2005 is to establish the rules of organisation and operation of the National Registry of Emission Rights (Renade) in development of the provisions of of Law 1/2005, which regulates the regime of trade in greenhouse gas emission rights in application of the provisions contained in the European regulations on the subject.

The Law No. 13/2010 modifies Law No. 1/2005. Its main objective is to regulate the trading of greenhouse gas emission rights, to encourage reductions in the emissions of these gases in an effective and economically efficient manner.

The Royal Decree No. 101/2011 establishes the basic rules that govern the accreditation and verification systems of greenhouse gas emissions and the tons-kilometer data of the air operators and of the allocation requests free of charge in the scope of Law 1/2005 which regulates the trading regime for greenhouse gas emission rights. It also regulates monitoring and reporting, and verifications of greenhouse gas emissions of the air operators.

The Royal Decree No. 301/2011 determines the mitigation measures that contribute to a reduction in emissions equivalent to that involved in the trading regime of greenhouse gas emission rights for the purpose of excluding it from the trading period that begins in 2013 of hospitals and small facilities. It considers as Small emitters those installations that have notified the competent authority of emissions of less than 25,000 equivalent tons of carbon dioxide, under the terms provided by law, and that, when carrying out combustion activities, have a nominal thermal power of less than 35 MW.

Royal Decree No. 655/2017 modifies Royal Decree No. 1.055 / 2014, which created a mechanism for offsetting costs of indirect greenhouse gas emissions for companies in certain industrial sectors and subsectors that are considered to be exposed to significant risk of ""carbon leakage"" (particularly affecting the prices of electricity).

1302,Finance Law 2018 and Second Rectifying Finance Law for 2017,"<strong>Carbon taxation:</strong> The budget law sets a trajectory for the carbon component of domestic consumption tax rates for the 2018-2022 period, with a more ambitious objective than that set by the law on the energy transition. Thus, the value of the carbon component of the tariffs for these taxes is set at 44.60 euros / tonne of CO2 in 2018 (instead of 39 euros initially), 55 euros in 2019 (against 47.5 euros) and 65 , 40 euros in 2020 (against 56 euros), to reach 86.20 euros in 2022. In addition, it is expected in the new tariffs of TICPE (domestic consumption tax on energy products) a convergence of the tariff of diesel towards the gasoline tariffs in four years, ie by 2021. This measure leads to an increase in the fixed portion of the TICPE applicable to road diesel by â‚¬ 2.6 per hectolitre per year for four years, which is in addition to that of the carbon portion programmed for the period 2018-2022.<br />

It remains based on the only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of vehicles without taking into account their pollutant emissions (fine particles, nitrogen oxides ...) but the trigger threshold of the malus has been lowered from 127 to 120 grams of CO2 / km. The law sets a progressive scale ranging from 50 euros for the least emitting vehicles to 10,500 euros for those emitting 185 g of CO2 / km or more.<br />

Ireland's energy policy addresses three core objectives: sustainability, security of supply, and competitiveness. It also addresses the need for affordable energy for domestic and business consumers.<br />
<br />
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050, and will fall to zero or below by 2100.<br />
Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target is to increase the share of national energy consumption made up of renewable energy sources (RES) to 16%. This target is broken into three key sectors with individual targets for each sector: 40% of electricity supply (RES-E), 12% of heating (RES-H), and 10% of transport (RES-T). Ireland also has a target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020.<br />
Renewable energy and improved energy efficiency will play vital roles in reducing emissions. Decisions about the development and deployment of new technologies will inform the renewable energy mix and impact on the role of citizens as energy consumers.<br />
By 2030, the Better Energy Programme will deliver enough deep energy efficiency upgrades to put the residential sector on a realistic trajectory to a low carbon energy future.<br />
Consumers will drive the transition by, for example, choosing to use less energy, adopting lower carbon options for transport and heating shifting energy use to o -peak times or investing in smart home technologies.Stable, transparent, evidence-based, and independent regulation is essential to facilitate competition, to support investment, and to ensure that the cost of capital and network costs are minimised.<br />

1454,The Swedish Climate Policy Framework,"In June 2017, Sweden's Riksdag introduced a climate policy framework with a <a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/climate-act/"">Climate Act</a> for Sweden. This framework sets out implementation of the Paris Agreement in Sweden. By 2045, Sweden is to have zero net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It outlines the government's policy towards mitigating emissions, as well as specific targets for emissions reductions. It contains three pillars for Sweden's climate change policy: (1) the Climate Act, (2) new goals for emissions reductions, and (3) establishing a climate policy council.

The Climate Act provides that Sweden's climate policy must be based on its climate goals, requires the government to present a climate report every year in its budget bill and produce a climate policy action plan that describes how it will achieve its climate goals and balance climate policy goals and budget policy goals.

The new emissions reductions it sets are: by 2030, Sweden will reduce emissions from domestic transport, excluding domestic aviation, by at least 70% and will reduce emissions from sectors covered by the EU Effort Sharing Regulation by at least 63%; by 2040, Sweden will reduce emissions from sectors covered by the EU Effort Sharing Regulation by at least 75% compared to a 1990 baseline; by 2045, Sweden will achieve carbon neutrality.

The Climate Policy Council will support the government by providing an independent assessment of whether the overall policy presented by the government is compatible with its climate goals. The council will also evaluate the likelihood of achieving the government's climate policy goals in various policy areas.",executive,Sweden,SWE,,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements,15/06/2017 | Law passed
